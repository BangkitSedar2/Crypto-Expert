2014-09-16T01:27:17  <kenel> guys
2014-09-16T01:27:27  <kenel> i really fucking think bcx might be baritus
2014-09-16T01:27:29  <kenel> i don't know why
2014-09-16T01:27:32  <kenel> i just have this gut feeling
2014-09-16T01:28:19  <cosmo> I'm baritus
2014-09-16T01:29:10  <kenel> also
2014-09-16T01:29:13  <kenel> i have an idea
2014-09-16T01:29:17  <kenel> let's announce a dgc foundation buyback
2014-09-16T01:29:23  <kenel> no one's going to sell right now
2014-09-16T01:29:47  <cosmo> buyback on what?
2014-09-16T01:29:50  <kenel> dgc
2014-09-16T01:29:56  <kenel> keep it off the markets
2014-09-16T01:30:00  <kenel> we can use trenal's escrow
2014-09-16T01:30:50  <cosmo> you're on drugs
2014-09-16T01:30:51  <kenel> foundation is going to announce a dgc buyback of all outstanding digitalcoin at spot price -15% for those no longer wishing to hold digitalcoin in their portfolio
2014-09-16T01:31:07  <kenel> buybacks occur when companies are up to something
2014-09-16T01:31:15  <kenel> they make prices go ridiculous :P
2014-09-16T01:31:16  <cosmo> it'd stimulate interest, yeah
2014-09-16T01:31:31  <cosmo> hey if you wanna drive the price up i won't complain
2014-09-16T01:31:50  <techbytes_> what is spot price -15%?  15% at market?
2014-09-16T01:32:13  <kenel> yeah, but we could say it's spot at the time of the announcement
2014-09-16T01:32:49  <techbytes_> yes, price will skyrocket and no one will be selling, win-win...
2014-09-16T01:33:18  <kenel> i have ~ 500$ in cash (1btc or so) that i'd be willing to deposit to do this
2014-09-16T01:36:01  <kenel> xawksow are you around by any chance?
2014-09-16T01:36:07  <techbytes_> how much are we willing to buy back?  If we are going to do it, has to be at least 200-300k to have an impact.
2014-09-16T01:36:13  <xawksow> yep
2014-09-16T01:36:25  <kenel> !trade 200000 dgc
2014-09-16T01:36:26  <Coine1ius> 200000 DGC equals 6.22000027 BTC or 3016.70$
2014-09-16T01:36:32  <cosmo> let's contact the chinese first man
2014-09-16T01:36:40  <techbytes_> doable
2014-09-16T01:36:46  <xawksow> good idea
2014-09-16T01:36:46  <kenel> i'd be at 1/7th that with my 500$ alone
2014-09-16T01:37:00  <kenel> oh, xawksow trenal said you could make his escrow service work ?
2014-09-16T01:37:05  <kenel> he says it doesn't currently work
2014-09-16T01:37:07  <techbytes_> cosmo, don't you want to wait until we have a new ANN thread?
2014-09-16T01:37:16  <xawksow> probably i can help yea
2014-09-16T01:37:38  <kenel> i'd like to use that escrow service for this
2014-09-16T01:37:53  <kenel> can i invite trenal in here, or can you contact trenal directly xawksow ?
2014-09-16T01:38:05  <xawksow> i will contact him
2014-09-16T01:38:07  <kenel> get some attention to some of the things DGC is doing
2014-09-16T01:38:56  <xawksow> i will try to get some cash to buy some back too
2014-09-16T01:39:39  <kenel> we can just hype the shit out of digitalcoin while we're all buying low
2014-09-16T01:39:54  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-16T01:40:08  <kenel> i mean here's the thing even, and i'm only saying this b/c tt's not here
2014-09-16T01:40:24  <kenel> worst come to worst, we buy low, and sell half back high; keep our money, and donate the rest to the foundation
2014-09-16T01:40:26  <kenel> or something
2014-09-16T01:40:50  <xawksow> i'm good with this :p
2014-09-16T01:41:18  <techbytes_> well, if you buy back, we have to keep it in the foundation and use it for development.  Can't buy hype and dump.
2014-09-16T01:41:30  <techbytes_> if we buy back
2014-09-16T01:41:40  <kenel> i said worst come to worst
2014-09-16T01:42:01  <techbytes_> we all put in 1 btc... should be enough
2014-09-16T01:42:28  <kenel> i don't know if RZ, for example, can swing 1btc
2014-09-16T01:43:03  <techbytes_> true
2014-09-16T01:43:11  <techbytes_> or ahmed
2014-09-16T01:43:21  <kenel> i can't swing more than 1btc atm because i fucking bought into kassado and his bullshit
2014-09-16T01:43:22  <kenel> fuck him.
2014-09-16T01:44:28  <vinje> ?
2014-09-16T01:44:32  <kenel> now that i have to run my second asic at home...
2014-09-16T01:44:39  <vinje> What happened there?
2014-09-16T01:44:40  <kenel> i have to sell ~ 50-60$ worth of dgc/month
2014-09-16T01:44:52  <kenel> wife's about to kill me over electric bill
2014-09-16T01:45:13  <kenel> oh you mean kassado king of hype with no output?
2014-09-16T01:45:21  <vinje> I know them feels about the power bills
2014-09-16T01:45:40  <kenel> i HAD almost 2btc worth of rby; now i have 1btc worth of rby and the same amount of rby
2014-09-16T01:45:52  <vinje> ouch.
2014-09-16T01:45:58  <vinje> I've got just under 20k of them
2014-09-16T01:46:03  <kenel> fucking guy is getting as bad as baritus
2014-09-16T01:46:11  <vinje> which is like 2.50
2014-09-16T01:46:15  <vinje> lol
2014-09-16T01:46:46  <kenel> i stupidly keep sending my personal DGC to people to get them more interested
2014-09-16T01:46:52  <kenel> so now it's time to mine it all back ;\
2014-09-16T01:47:12  <kenel> i'm moving my two blades to my office
2014-09-16T01:47:23  <kenel> so +10mh/s will be ~ 60mh/s with
2014-09-16T01:47:48  <vinje> It will be good to see.  :)
2014-09-16T01:48:08  <vinje> I'm going all in dgc just as soon as POS happens w/ ruby
2014-09-16T01:48:42  <vinje> maybe before then.
2014-09-16T01:49:08  <kenel> i give up on kassado
2014-09-16T01:49:12  <kenel> his trade bot is a great idea
2014-09-16T01:49:14  <techbytes_> when we release the wallet update, how long should we set the fork at?  1 month, 2?
2014-09-16T01:49:17  <kenel> we should steal his idea
2014-09-16T01:49:26  <kenel> i'd say less than that even techbytes
2014-09-16T01:49:27  <xawksow> 2 weeks
2014-09-16T01:49:30  <kenel> 2 weeks, 3 weeks

2014-09-16T01:51:05  <techbytes_> been thinking about it a while but now i have a reason to.

2014-09-16T02:23:20  <kenel> no, she does slur her s's and can't get 'th' down right
2014-09-16T02:23:39  <cosmo> sometimes i wish i'd been diagnosed as a child so i'd have a history i could use to get welfare :3 hate me
2014-09-16T02:23:42  <kenel> but at the same time, before she worked with me, my mom has a graduate degree in speech pathology....
2014-09-16T02:23:47  <kenel> and she hasn't said a fucking thing to me
2014-09-16T02:23:49  <kenel> so....
2014-09-16T02:24:02  <kenel> do i trust my mom's judgement or a grad student at a local catholic college

2014-09-16T02:27:57  <kenel> he reminds me of you actually, lol
2014-09-16T02:28:10  <kenel> he kept going 'why do people get out of your way, but i have to weave in between them?'

2014-09-16T20:53:45  <techbytes-lenovo> ads for free service?  why not...
2014-09-16T20:54:10  <xawksow> dafuq
2014-09-16T20:56:01  <techbytes-lenovo> we show their ads and we get free vps hosting?
2014-09-16T20:56:16  <xawksow> i think we will get free vps anyway
2014-09-16T20:56:28  <xawksow> but by showing ads we will get additionally 30% of the customer payments
2014-09-16T20:56:48  <xawksow> which will be xtra foundation cash
2014-09-16T20:58:35  <techbytes-lenovo> yeah... might want to look into asic hardware companies and see if we can sell them some ad spaces as well.  After the new forum is in place of course.
2014-09-16T20:58:42  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-16T20:58:48  <xawksow> would definitely be a good idea

2014-09-18T02:13:39  <cosmo> i'm planning on moving to the poorest area so i don't have to pay that kind of extortion to brainwash the nations youth
2014-09-18T02:13:49  <vinje> Not the one I work for, (too fn espensive) but a really good one
2014-09-18T02:13:56  <kenel> private school is the way to go man. i don't need the fucking state telling me how to raise my kids
2014-09-18T02:13:57  <kenel> fuck them
2014-09-18T02:13:59  <vinje> My 13 yr old goes to a pretty rough public school.
2014-09-18T02:14:09  <cosmo> but that's what you're doing anyway :\
2014-09-18T02:14:11  <vinje> but he's fn spongy as it is and needs to harden the fuck up
2014-09-18T02:14:27  <kenel> i have the best public schools in the southside and i can't even send my kids there because of this arab mafia
2014-09-18T02:14:31  <kenel> such is life
2014-09-18T02:14:45  <cosmo> i think school taxes where i live are about 7k a year
2014-09-18T02:14:58  <kenel> i pay ~ 8k/yr total
2014-09-18T02:15:01  <kenel> 50% of it is for school
2014-09-18T02:15:10  <cosmo> think my parents do about 12k a year
2014-09-18T02:15:27  <vinje> tuition here is 10k a year for the employees :)
2014-09-18T02:15:31  <cosmo> it's a real laugh to see the school replace the fake turf every three years, and the stadium lights every four
2014-09-18T02:16:11  <kenel> you here about the shit where the landscapers mowed the turf on the east coast?
2014-09-18T02:16:16  <cosmo> i'm making shit up but it's retarded
2014-09-18T02:16:19  <kenel> those artificial turfs cost ~ 3 million
2014-09-18T02:16:50  <cosmo> also how they fucking leave the lights on when there's nothing going on
2014-09-18T02:17:01  <kenel> ....so there's no shady shit going on in the field....
2014-09-18T02:17:03  <cosmo> there's a cool mechanic who lives right by the high school who calculated the costs of the lights
2014-09-18T02:17:04  <kenel> it's a security issue not to
2014-09-18T02:17:15  <cosmo> christ
2014-09-18T02:17:23  <cosmo> worst thing they'd ever have to deal with is probably a little graffiti
2014-09-18T02:17:32  <kenel> the cost of a lawsuit of kids partying on the field while it's dark and potentially dying is greater than the cost of leaving the lights on
2014-09-18T02:17:42  <cosmo> like they're scared of their own shadow, whenever the sun sets, rapists abound
2014-09-18T02:17:50  <cosmo> that's true
2014-09-18T02:17:51  <kenel> it's not about rape
2014-09-18T02:17:59  <kenel> it's about these parents have no control over their kids anymore
2014-09-18T02:18:05  <kenel> and the kids have no respect for authority anymore
2014-09-18T02:18:09  <cosmo> because they're such awful examples
2014-09-18T02:18:12  <kenel> and if you live in a rich neighborhood....
2014-09-18T02:18:21  <kenel> it's not beer they're stealing
2014-09-18T02:18:26  <kenel> it's coke and shit they're buying
2014-09-18T02:18:34  <cosmo> let's just kill each other
2014-09-18T02:18:36  <kenel> we used to steal beer
2014-09-18T02:18:44  <cosmo> no, YOU used to steal beer
2014-09-18T02:18:44  <kenel> in the rich neighborhoods, they all do coke
2014-09-18T02:18:56  <cosmo> fucking i don't know
2014-09-18T02:19:07  <cosmo> all it is around here is weed afaik
2014-09-18T02:19:19  <kenel> eh, irish don't usually do weed
2014-09-18T02:19:20  <vinje> I'm in a pretty decent neighborhood but some of the natives here stabbed a 16yr old girl to death 20m from my door
2014-09-18T02:19:33  <kenel> sounds domestic vinje
2014-09-18T02:19:48  <cosmo> it is usually
2014-09-18T02:19:55  <cosmo> internal affairs
2014-09-18T02:19:57  <vinje> na, this ...demographic doesn't usually have a place to live
2014-09-18T02:20:11  <kenel> fucking aussieland
2014-09-18T02:20:14  <vinje> single flipflop wearing motherfuckers
2014-09-18T02:20:16  <kenel> why the fuck you still there dude?
2014-09-18T02:20:22  <kenel> move to colorado or oregon
2014-09-18T02:20:33  <vinje> I'd move back to seattle in a heartbeat
2014-09-18T02:20:37  <xawksow> move to germany
2014-09-18T02:20:40  <xawksow> public schools are free
2014-09-18T02:20:43  <kenel> dude
2014-09-18T02:20:44  <xawksow> and no one gets stabbed
2014-09-18T02:20:44  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-18T02:20:47  <vinje> Good job, great weather, decent enough coffee
2014-09-18T02:20:51  <kenel> you'd move to the heart of stalinism?
2014-09-18T02:20:58  <kenel> seattle is about as liberal as it gets

2014-09-18T03:09:55  <kenel> xawksow where is the digitalcoin foundation mission statement i created?
2014-09-18T03:11:08  <cosmo> why not just 'contact us'
2014-09-18T03:11:28  <kenel> there is no contact us on the website right now
2014-09-18T03:11:43  <cosmo> it shouldn't sound like we run DGC
2014-09-18T03:12:05  <cosmo> don't like the sound of the word 'ranks'
2014-09-18T03:12:27  <kenel> who runs dgc?
2014-09-18T03:12:47  <cosmo> nobody it runs itself, we just bother to update it when it could us updating
2014-09-18T03:13:22  <kenel> eh, i don't agree, but those last three words are just filler
2014-09-18T03:13:25  <kenel> so i can remove them
2014-09-18T03:13:41  <kenel> you didn't influence me, you just made me realize they were filler :P
2014-09-18T03:13:45  <cosmo> replace it with 'people'
2014-09-18T03:13:49  <cosmo> yeah ok
2014-09-18T03:13:52  <kenel> i'm not in 3rd grade
2014-09-18T03:13:59  <kenel> where is the goddamn mission statement i wrote
2014-09-18T03:14:41  <cosmo> and i disagree, dgc runs itself, bitcoin runs itself
2014-09-18T03:14:44  <kenel> The DigitalCoin Foundation's mission is to preserve,standardize, and advocate the use of DigitalCoin as a globally accepted, innovative, low cost method of transmitting currency.
2014-09-18T03:14:47  <cosmo> that's why it's so awesome, nobody controls it
2014-09-18T03:15:26  <cosmo> method of transmitting currency = medium of trade
2014-09-18T03:15:53  <kenel> method of trade
2014-09-18T03:16:08  <kenel> let me think about that
2014-09-18T03:16:19  <cosmo> it's not technically a currency
2014-09-18T03:16:23  <kenel> also we don't debate public discussion
2014-09-18T03:16:32  <kenel> forward thinking
2014-09-18T03:16:44  <cosmo> you mean moderate public discussion? what i wrote originally
2014-09-18T03:16:51  <kenel> yes
2014-09-18T03:17:09  <kenel> i think this is fine for this section

2014-09-18T03:17:15  <kenel> instead of adding another sentence
2014-09-18T03:18:19  <kenel> well then
2014-09-18T03:18:21  <cosmo> sounds good, gets a little repetitive with all them commas
2014-09-18T03:18:23  <kenel> you went to a good school
2014-09-18T03:18:34  <cosmo> nah i'm just not stupid
2014-09-18T03:18:40  <kenel> you know to define acronyms before you use them
2014-09-18T03:18:43  <kenel> most people don't
2014-09-18T03:18:48  <kenel> (DGCF)
2014-09-18T03:18:52  <kenel> for example
2014-09-18T03:19:11  <cosmo> most people gave up on common sense when they had to pay a bill of some kind
2014-09-18T03:19:20  <kenel> i can remove the commas on the last two

2014-09-18T03:19:53  <kenel> the problem with a mission statement is you want it to be ~ 25 words at most and express literally everything you're trying to do
2014-09-18T03:20:04  <cosmo> yeah
2014-09-18T03:20:04  <kenel> a tagline is different
2014-09-18T03:20:07  <kenel> i like taglines better :)
2014-09-18T03:20:16  <cosmo> i spent forever rewriting the description on the subreddit and i'm still not happy with it
2014-09-18T03:21:41  <cosmo> 'advocate, standardize, and preserve' might be better order for that
2014-09-18T03:22:10  <kenel> we can probably just use...
2014-09-18T03:22:15  <kenel> standardize and advocate
2014-09-18T03:22:20  <cosmo> or just advocate :p
2014-09-18T03:22:26  <cosmo> eh
2014-09-18T03:22:28  <kenel> nah, we want to standardize it
2014-09-18T03:22:33  <cosmo> yeah
2014-09-18T03:22:38  <kenel> preserve is just...
2014-09-18T03:22:42  <kenel> it's a filler word
2014-09-18T03:22:44  <vinje> back later guys.

2014-09-18T03:23:28  <cosmo> replace that last and with a comma and perfect
2014-09-18T03:23:42  <kenel> we don't even need innovative even

2014-09-18T03:24:00  <kenel> innovative is a filler word
2014-09-18T03:24:23  <kenel> it's a cryptocurrency; it's innovative
2014-09-18T03:24:25  <kenel> who cares
2014-09-18T03:25:56  <cosmo> also 'trusted -digitalcoin- community members' just 'trusted community members'
2014-09-18T03:26:37  <cosmo> The Foundation's mission
2014-09-18T03:26:58  <kenel> what community?
2014-09-18T03:26:58  <cosmo> saying "digitalcoin" four times in two sentences is beating em over the head with it
2014-09-18T03:27:15  <cosmo> i guess it can be assumed

2014-09-18T03:29:47  <kenel> copywriting sucks
2014-09-18T03:31:16  <cosmo> are we an independant body? is *anyone* who's willing to dedicate their time to DGC eligible to join?
2014-09-18T03:31:25  <kenel> nope
2014-09-18T03:31:46  <cosmo> aw, i don't see why not, as long as sensitive info like the github account are kept strictly to the devs
2014-09-18T03:31:51  <kenel> we are independant
2014-09-18T03:31:58  <kenel> who controls us?
2014-09-18T03:32:21  <cosmo> well, if we look that way people will claim we're controlling DGC or some kinda bullshit
2014-09-18T03:32:46  <kenel> people are never going to trust a coin that doesn't have some sort of trustworthy body in charge of it
2014-09-18T03:32:57  <cosmo> yeah
2014-09-18T03:32:58  <kenel> that's the discussion TT and I were having a while back in here
2014-09-18T03:33:11  <cosmo> meh it's whatever i won't raise a stink over it
2014-09-18T03:33:15  <kenel> i get what you're saying
2014-09-18T03:33:20  <kenel> but at the same time....
2014-09-18T03:33:32  <kenel> we're bringing this fantasy world of anarchy crypto to the real business world
2014-09-18T03:33:40  <kenel> and people are only listening to us because of who is involved
2014-09-18T03:34:15  <kenel> meaning we're the trustworthy body
2014-09-18T03:34:26  <cosmo> yeah
2014-09-18T03:34:31  <kenel> we disappear or stop development and dgc dies
2014-09-18T03:34:50  <cosmo> so long as we remain open to new members it's cool
2014-09-18T03:35:06  <cosmo> and we can be picky, i guess
2014-09-18T03:35:10  <kenel> we're open to new members, but the guys that are here right now
2014-09-18T03:35:15  <kenel> the ones that are left...have dgc in interest
2014-09-18T03:35:18  <kenel> mikey obviously didn't
2014-09-18T03:35:24  <kenel> clapy had himself in interest
2014-09-18T03:35:27  <kenel> threestar god knows
2014-09-18T03:35:31  <kenel> this is it man
2014-09-18T03:35:41  <cosmo> i guess so
2014-09-18T03:35:43  <kenel> you guys endured the good, the bad, the ugly, and the renaissance
2014-09-18T03:35:47  <kenel> we're it
2014-09-18T03:36:04  <cosmo> i just feel like i myself wouldn't have a chance getting in if i hadn't been here from the beginning
2014-09-18T03:36:05  <kenel> rawdawg just wants to play games
2014-09-18T03:36:10  <cosmo> just don't wanna shun out potential

2014-09-18T03:38:07  <kenel> you find two better qualified people than him and i, and i'll gladly step back

2014-09-18T03:39:11  <kenel> i was taught you say the sentence in your head without the other person
2014-09-18T03:39:20  <kenel> 'you find a better qualified person than me.....'
2014-09-18T03:39:40  <cosmo> than i? whatever

2014-09-18T03:41:27  <kenel> yes, you guys post something like "DGC TO THE MOON!" right below so you can edit it later
2014-09-18T03:41:43  <cosmo> alright
2014-09-18T03:41:54  <cosmo> you should take the first three
2014-09-18T03:42:15  <cosmo> it's always good to flood the first page with trusted posters
2014-09-18T03:42:43  <kenel> i can't
2014-09-18T03:42:51  <kenel> when i posted the first new ann thread, someone posted in like 15 seconds
2014-09-18T03:42:54  <kenel> it was ridiculous
2014-09-18T03:43:12  <RunningmanZ> kenel:yeah sorry was afk
2014-09-18T03:43:25  <RunningmanZ> cooking lunch lol
2014-09-18T03:43:27  <kenel> ok, so there's two
2014-09-18T03:43:35  <kenel> we need like 4 people here
2014-09-18T03:45:26  <kenel> when i post, i need you guys to like instantly post replies
2014-09-18T03:45:29  <kenel> shit like
2014-09-18T03:45:37  <kenel> 'so glad to be part of the foundation, let's do this!'
2014-09-18T03:45:43  <kenel> something like that
2014-09-18T03:45:44  <RunningmanZ> Ok
2014-09-18T03:45:53  <kenel> because 'reserved' is banned on bitcointalk
2014-09-18T03:45:59  <RunningmanZ> yeah
2014-09-18T03:45:59  <kenel> something you can edit later
2014-09-18T03:46:21  <RunningmanZ> Maybe we can put something on the DGC forum with the active DGC related links we need to keep an eye on?
2014-09-18T03:46:27  <RunningmanZ> and update
2014-09-18T03:46:33  <RunningmanZ> in our foundation section
2014-09-18T03:46:51  <RunningmanZ> because its hard otherwise to keep track of the various links
2014-09-18T03:47:02  <RunningmanZ> and threads
2014-09-18T03:47:14  <kenel> that'll work
2014-09-18T03:47:26  <RunningmanZ> Yeah that way we can all check it each day
2014-09-18T03:47:33  <RunningmanZ> and update were necessary
2014-09-18T03:47:35  <RunningmanZ> where*
2014-09-18T03:48:06  <RunningmanZ> Plus it helps give me things to add to the DGC FB page
2014-09-18T03:48:50  <RunningmanZ> So under member discussions as a sticky?

2014-09-18T04:42:00  <cosmo> probably not
2014-09-18T04:42:21  <cosmo> worth it to get people to flood the first page with good words though.

2014-09-18T05:02:58  <kenel> does it need to be in two columns?
2014-09-18T05:03:02  <kenel> it almost looks fine this way
2014-09-18T05:03:03  <kenel> i don't know
2014-09-18T05:03:05  <RunningmanZ> Some things still out of alignment in IE and under Services it has some code "table width etc"
2014-09-18T05:03:08  <kenel> why the fuck is it not working
2014-09-18T05:03:26  <RunningmanZ> No idea I'm not a web page guru. Anyone?

2014-09-18T05:17:48  <cosmo> you gave me the code you already changed, no tables :(

2014-09-18T05:18:48  <cosmo> yeah btctalk fucked it up
2014-09-18T05:19:12  <kenel> i don't know, as soon as i hit 'submit' it changed the way it looked completely

2014-09-18T05:19:49  <kenel> we got btc38's attention btw
2014-09-18T05:23:00  <kenel> so bitcointalk is running a very old version of smf
2014-09-18T05:23:11  <kenel> it doesn't have all the features 2.0+ does
2014-09-18T05:23:15  <kenel> that's why it's fucking up
2014-09-18T05:24:17  <kenel> i'm comparing the vb code you have on dgc forum to what baritus originally posted, and baritus' has a ton ton ton ton ton more tables
2014-09-18T05:24:32  <kenel> cosmo ^
2014-09-18T05:24:53  <cosmo> yeah it does, every time you see two columns that's a table
2014-09-18T05:24:55  <kenel> i'm thinking the new smf has some sort of built in thing for making tables look pretty
2014-09-18T05:25:07  <cosmo> also bitcointalk is the problem
2014-09-18T05:25:15  <kenel> oh no, i know bitcointalk is the problem
2014-09-18T05:25:24  <kenel> the way you did it is right
2014-09-18T05:25:31  <kenel> two columns
2014-09-18T05:25:37  <kenel> the way bitcoin talk wants it is like 100 tables
2014-09-18T05:25:41  <cosmo> those dots telligory has are what's expanding the tables
2014-09-18T05:26:25  <kenel> i have to go to bed in 4 minutes
2014-09-18T05:26:33  <kenel> i don't need anything tonight
2014-09-18T05:26:47  <kenel> but you think we can have a proper 'bitcointalk' format by this weekend? :P
2014-09-18T05:26:55  <cosmo> i can nigrig it real fast

2014-09-18T05:36:25  <cosmo> what

2014-09-18T05:37:38  <kenel> i did because i got pissed it wasn't working/readable, and i saw btc38 post, and said 'fuck just make it readable'
2014-09-18T05:37:57  <kenel> the td was above 'wallet'

2014-09-18T12:11:31  <techbytes> don't have any to sell...
2014-09-18T12:17:30  <samson_> I've been thinking about the transaction fees for data storage, I think we should make it exponentially more expensive to store larger amounts up to 1024 bytes
2014-09-18T12:17:56  <xawksow> so not X
2014-09-18T12:18:00  <xawksow> X * transaction_fee
2014-09-18T12:18:11  <samson_> I propose something like this :
2014-09-18T12:18:14  <xawksow> transaction_fee^x ? :D
2014-09-18T12:18:30  <samson_> 256 bytes 2 x DGC Minimum Transaction fee
2014-09-18T12:18:30  <samson_> 512 bytes 4 x DGC Minimum transaction fee
2014-09-18T12:18:31  <samson_> 768 bytes 8 x DGC Minimum transaction fee
2014-09-18T12:18:31  <samson_> 1024 bytes 16 x DGC Minimum transaction fee
2014-09-18T12:18:55  <samson_> just doubles up for each 'step'
2014-09-18T12:19:05  <samson_> Not sure if it's viable
2014-09-18T12:19:19  <xawksow> the transfee is 0.01
2014-09-18T12:19:24  <xawksow> right?
2014-09-18T12:19:26  <samson_> This would be to encourage people to use the resource sensibly
2014-09-18T12:19:39  <samson_> It's changing to 0.1 I believe after the meeting on Sunday
2014-09-18T12:19:44  <xawksow> oh yea
2014-09-18T12:19:46  <xawksow> ok
2014-09-18T12:19:50  <samson_> So 1024 bytes would be 1.6 DGC
2014-09-18T12:20:21  <samson_> I'm sure if DGC ever hits $0.5 to $1 then the transaction fee would be adjusted down
2014-09-18T12:21:15  <xawksow> well you fee plan is good
2014-09-18T12:21:20  <samson_> Thanks
2014-09-18T12:21:22  <xawksow> couldn't figure out a better one by now
2014-09-18T12:21:22  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-18T12:21:42  <xawksow> yea, i think we will hit the 1$ again soon
2014-09-18T12:21:48  <xawksow> maybe end of the year
2014-09-18T12:21:57  <samson_> I'll refine the text and make a post on the foundation members forum and Ahmed can give his verdict as to whether it's enforcable
2014-09-18T12:22:05  <xawksow> ok
2014-09-18T12:22:25  <samson_> If we can get a lot of devs on board things will be driven by innovation
2014-09-18T12:22:33  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-18T12:22:38  <xawksow> but then we need to keep track of their changes

2014-09-18T12:31:13  <xawksow> but for me i need to read into that as well

2014-09-18T12:31:41  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-18T12:31:42  <xawksow> op
2014-09-18T12:32:13  <xawksow> do you have any other things in mind we could do with that raw transactions?
2014-09-18T12:32:44  <xawksow> i'm thinking of secure messaging somehow
2014-09-18T12:33:05  <samson_> Not offhand, the timestamping thing is something else I was working on so when someone mentioned a hard fork I thought it would be a good way to utilise data
2014-09-18T12:33:12  <samson_> Messaging could be useful
2014-09-18T12:33:23  <samson_> I'm concerned about blockchain bloat on a long term basis though
2014-09-18T12:33:29  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-18T12:33:39  <xawksow> that's what i'm thinkin too
2014-09-18T12:33:44  <samson_> If a lot of people use it there might be a case for splitting nodes into two categories
2014-09-18T12:33:58  <xawksow> if that is possible
2014-09-18T12:33:59  <xawksow> sure
2014-09-18T12:34:16  <samson_> 1 - Regular node which perhaps stores just a hash of the stored data - these nodes would not be able to distribute old blocks to new chain downloaders
2014-09-18T12:34:32  <samson_> 2 - Full nodes which store the full blockchain and it's data / data hash
2014-09-18T12:34:38  <xawksow> well
2014-09-18T12:34:38  <xawksow> or
2014-09-18T12:34:46  <xawksow> depending on what data needs to be stored
2014-09-18T12:34:58  <xawksow> derp
2014-09-18T12:35:00  <samson_> So the hash of the data could be mined into the block - not the data
2014-09-18T12:35:01  <xawksow> wait
2014-09-18T12:35:06  <ahmed_> samson_: node type 1 = SPV node
2014-09-18T12:35:11  <ahmed_> node type 2 = standard node
2014-09-18T12:35:15  <samson_> SPV ?
2014-09-18T12:35:21  <samson_> like lite nodes ?
2014-09-18T12:35:24  <xawksow> that what my java wallet uses
2014-09-18T12:35:25  <ahmed_> yep
2014-09-18T12:35:31  <xawksow> it can get blocks but won't send em
2014-09-18T12:35:33  <samson_> ah yes, I see
2014-09-18T12:35:37  <ahmed_> like the android wallet and xawksow's and hashengineering's java wallets
2014-09-18T12:36:09  <samson_> Would it take much to create a qt SPV node / wallet ?
2014-09-18T12:36:26  <ahmed_> well QT wise i suck
2014-09-18T12:36:41  <samson_> I doubt you would actually need to change the look / feel
2014-09-18T12:37:02  <ahmed_> but realistically why make a qt spv node, when multi-bit, and xawksow's wallet do the same thing but work better
2014-09-18T12:37:09  <samson_> I've never used QT - isn't it just a bolt on for the front end ?
2014-09-18T12:37:24  <ahmed_> qt is the framework used to build the frontend
2014-09-18T12:37:25  <samson_> Yes, good point Ahmed
2014-09-18T12:37:56  <samson_> I guess what I mean is - if we had a SPV wallet that looked and bahaved like the regular QT wallet nobody would have anything to complain about
2014-09-18T12:38:00  <ahmed_> do any of you guys have scrypt hashrate i can borrow?
2014-09-18T12:38:14  <ahmed_> samson_: true, except if an idiot tries to make rpc calls from it
2014-09-18T12:38:19  <ahmed_> e.g. for mining
2014-09-18T12:38:20  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-18T12:38:30  <xawksow> that would fuck it up
2014-09-18T12:38:43  <xawksow> can't we change that?
2014-09-18T12:38:50  <samson_> You're never going to stop idiots from doing idiotic things...
2014-09-18T12:38:51  <xawksow> an spv wallet with mining support
2014-09-18T12:38:52  <xawksow> :D

2014-09-18T12:39:04  <xawksow> which could mine a little bit of scrypt
2014-09-18T12:39:16  <samson_> I have no Scrypt hash at all I'm afraid
2014-09-18T12:39:33  <xawksow> they are near me, so for a short time it is okay before it gets annoying :p
2014-09-18T12:39:41  <samson_> If you really need it maybe we could just rent some from somewhere
2014-09-18T12:39:53  <samson_> not sure how feasible that is though
2014-09-18T12:40:02  <xawksow> renting works good

2014-09-18T12:49:41  <samson_> Exactly - all in the name of 'security'
2014-09-18T12:49:50  <xawksow> yea sure..
2014-09-18T12:50:31  <samson_> Here they steal the whole ATM, I could just see the idiots going through it looking for the Bitcoins after they took the cash
2014-09-18T12:50:41  <xawksow> hahahahahahaha
2014-09-18T12:50:42  <xawksow> XD

2014-09-18T12:51:29  <samson_> Seriously though - they have drinking water vending machines where you put about 5 cents in for a few liters of water
2014-09-18T12:51:37  <samson_> People rob the coins out of them
2014-09-18T12:52:14  <xawksow> lol
2014-09-18T12:52:18  <xawksow> wtf is dis
2014-09-18T12:53:39  <xawksow> in my location they try to get on the ATM's cash by putting gas into it and let it explode. that is not always workin out, they have blown a whole entrance of a supermarket a few months ago
2014-09-18T13:05:06  <xawksow> chinese are buyin
2014-09-18T13:05:43  <ahmed_> samson_: just some hash so i can get back to work on the pool
2014-09-18T13:06:15  <samson_> I can buy some hash - how many MH/s do you need to work on it ?
2014-09-18T13:06:58  <ahmed_> samson_: no idea it's cool tho ive got some BTC. just cba making an account
2014-09-18T13:07:55  <samson_> ok

2014-09-18T13:10:53  <techbytes-lenovo> what happen to multicoin hashes?
2014-09-18T13:10:57  <ahmed_> techbytes-lenovo: scrypt
2014-09-18T13:11:03  <ahmed_> im testing it out on spaincoin
2014-09-18T13:11:11  <ahmed_> and multicoin-hashes are gone
2014-09-18T13:11:18  <ahmed_> im recoding it cause it was slow as shit before
2014-09-18T13:11:23  <techbytes-lenovo> gone to the dogs?
2014-09-18T13:11:39  <techbytes-lenovo> i can send 28mh but for how long?
2014-09-18T13:11:45  <ahmed_> unsure really not asked t3xploit
2014-09-18T13:11:55  <ahmed_> about an hour would be god
2014-09-18T13:12:01  <ahmed_> just need to get some shares in my db

2014-09-18T13:14:11  <cosmo> does your daughter watch mlp?

2014-09-18T13:15:00  <techbytes-lenovo> ok
2014-09-18T13:15:09  <kenel-work> my daughter has binge watched ponies 3x through already and we're going on 4 now
2014-09-18T13:15:10  <ahmed_> techbytes-lenovo: gimme a spaincoin address too if u have one
2014-09-18T13:15:50  <cosmo> what if she grows up a chantard
2014-09-18T13:17:27  <kenel-work> she's only allowed to watch tv for ~ an hour/2 per day
2014-09-18T13:18:06  <kenel-work> also i don't worry about my kids being lazy :)
2014-09-18T13:18:29  <kenel-work> daughter is 3 and probably has more landscaping experience than you do at whatever age you are
2014-09-18T13:19:42  <cosmo> i am also 3
2014-09-18T13:19:52  <kenel-work> for some reason i sometimes believe that
2014-09-18T13:20:00  <kenel-work> benjamin button or some shit
2014-09-18T13:20:13  <ahmed_> xawksow: i think we have an issue
2014-09-18T13:20:23  <cosmo> i do feel that way sometimes
2014-09-18T13:20:32  <ahmed_> in the V3 client there's no IRC support for finding new connections
2014-09-18T13:20:48  <ahmed_> but the current V2 clients are heavily dependent on IRC
2014-09-18T13:20:55  <xawksow> so
2014-09-18T13:20:57  <ahmed_> (i count 89 dgc clients in the irc room right now)
2014-09-18T13:21:05  <xawksow> then why not merge it into it
2014-09-18T13:21:17  <ahmed_> cause the code is all over the place haha
2014-09-18T13:21:21  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-18T13:21:22  <xawksow> shit

2014-09-18T13:22:03  <ahmed_> cosmo: yeah right
2014-09-18T13:22:11  <ahmed_> techbytes-lenovo: yeah i can tell its erroring out right now :D
2014-09-18T13:23:15  <xawksow> well, but we could add some hardcoded seed nodes to get the blockchain to the new wallets
2014-09-18T13:23:24  <xawksow> v2 needs to update anyway after oour fork block
2014-09-18T13:23:30  <techbytes-lenovo> ahmed_ getting accepted share
2014-09-18T13:23:48  <ahmed_> xawksow: yep true
2014-09-18T13:23:54  <ahmed_> techbytes-lenovo: yep i see em :)

2014-09-18T13:24:22  <xawksow> currently trying to build the wallet on windows
2014-09-18T13:24:23  <xawksow> x]
2014-09-18T13:25:39  <ahmed_> xawksow: good luck haha
2014-09-18T13:25:43  <ahmed_> @nicks #digitalcoin00
2014-09-18T13:25:43  <CryptoExpert> ahmed_: Error: I'm not in #digitalcoin00.
2014-09-18T13:25:52  <xawksow> yea looks like a hard task xD
2014-09-18T13:26:03  <ahmed_> xawksow: it is
2014-09-18T13:26:07  <ahmed_> i couldnt do it :)
2014-09-18T13:26:15  <cosmo> there's isn't a step-by-step history of what baritus changed from the original fork on github?
2014-09-18T13:26:28  <ahmed_> cosmo: he purposely avoids adding it
2014-09-18T13:27:02  <cosmo> are you serious
2014-09-18T13:27:15  <cosmo> we gotta convince baritus to hang around
2014-09-18T13:29:36  <ahmed_> cosmo: im serious

2014-09-18T14:09:46  <cosmo> this is bullshit though
2014-09-18T14:09:52  <cosmo> we need baritus to tell us what he changed
2014-09-18T14:10:13  <cosmo> you can't expect to pick through the entire client and piece every little bit together
2014-09-18T14:10:39  <cosmo> kenel-work has he contacted you about whatever it was he had to turn over?
2014-09-18T14:19:06  <ahmed_> cosmo: no we dont
2014-09-18T14:19:26  <ahmed_> the client syncs up to main-net fine
2014-09-18T14:19:38  <ahmed_> if it didnt work then we'd have to pick through the old client
2014-09-18T14:19:45  <ahmed_> but it works so we dont :)
2014-09-18T14:20:02  <cosmo> eh, okay
2014-09-18T14:22:37  <samson_> Aren't the old clients still on Github anyway - they used to be on a different account before DGC2, I can't remember what it was but I don't think it was on the baritus account
2014-09-18T14:24:43  <cosmo> i dunno why but i just baritus' old work over digibyte
2014-09-18T14:26:11  <ahmed_> samson_: just v2 i think
2014-09-18T14:26:25  <ahmed_> cosmo: because he was the original dev
2014-09-18T14:27:05  <ahmed_> but really the best thing we can do is test. thats all we can do
2014-09-18T14:28:19  <cosmo> or convince baritus to help out with this last update so we can reimplement what he did, but meh
2014-09-18T14:29:01  <cosmo> he lists the changes he made in his posts on the dgc forums

2014-09-18T14:29:59  <ahmed_> cosmo: the changes arent enough tho
2014-09-18T14:30:06  <ahmed_> the code is whats needed if he's to help
2014-09-18T14:30:31  <cosmo> well, if it's even worth keeping is what i'm saying
2014-09-18T14:30:50  <cosmo> all he ever did was tweak the diff/block reward values, and implement better networking
2014-09-18T14:31:05  <ahmed_> yeah i dont agree
2014-09-18T14:31:13  <ahmed_> i dont see any better networking in his code
2014-09-18T14:31:24  <cosmo> lol, ok
2014-09-18T14:31:27  <ahmed_> infact the networking in there sucks like hell
2014-09-18T14:31:52  <ahmed_> its heavily reliant on IRC. if the devs of smutfairy shut it down like rizon just did. DGC would be fucked
2014-09-18T14:32:06  <samson_> What source are you looking for ?
2014-09-18T14:32:17  <ahmed_>  samson_ v1
2014-09-18T14:32:20  <samson_> I have a file named digitalcoin-qt-v1.zip
2014-09-18T14:32:23  <cosmo> as long as we include dedicated seeds to jumpstart the network that's all that's needed right?
2014-09-18T14:32:35  <samson_> I'll check to see what's inside it
2014-09-18T14:32:35  <ahmed_> cosmo: in v3 yep
2014-09-18T14:32:52  <cosmo> alrighty
2014-09-18T14:32:59  <cosmo> maybe we should get digibytedev in here then :p
2014-09-18T14:33:09  <samson_> I never delete anything once I've downloaded it
2014-09-18T14:33:40  <samson_> It has no source though
2014-09-18T14:33:45  <ahmed_> cosmo: we could
2014-09-18T14:33:53  <ahmed_> or i could get 8bit in here
2014-09-18T14:34:02  <ahmed_> i dont think theres much need tho
2014-09-18T14:34:11  <ahmed_> me and xawksow are capable imo
2014-09-18T14:34:37  <cosmo> alright
2014-09-18T14:34:47  <cosmo> looks like digibyte released a new version, 3.0.2
2014-09-18T14:35:50  <cosmo> scrypt algo was hanging up

2014-09-18T14:38:16  <ahmed_> he's only got the init commit like a newb or somone with something to hide
2014-09-18T14:41:38  <cosmo> i don't follow, looks like that github was only active for a week
2014-09-18T14:41:53  <ahmed_> cosmo: the first commit
2014-09-18T14:42:01  <ahmed_> he added the full dgc source
2014-09-18T14:42:07  <ahmed_> he didnt document what he changed like this
2014-09-18T14:42:15  <samson_> so it's not the original but based on it ?
2014-09-18T14:42:27  <ahmed_> samson_: its the original
2014-09-18T14:42:33  <samson_> ok cool
2014-09-18T14:42:33  <ahmed_> but a backup
2014-09-18T14:42:39  <samson_> problem solved ?
2014-09-18T14:42:51  <cosmo> oh, he didn't post the coin he forked from

2014-09-18T14:50:13  <ahmed_> wtaf V2 is a dogecoin fork?????
2014-09-18T14:50:21  <samson_> ugh

2014-09-18T14:50:51  <ahmed_> samson_: tis fine
2014-09-18T14:50:55  <ahmed_> that fork u pasted was v0.1

2014-09-18T14:53:10  <RunningmanZ> samson_:If you want an easy way to get BTC try Virwox. You can buy it via Paypal or Credit card. USD -> SLL -> BTC. There are some fees but its the quickest and easiest way I know. The limits start off low tho
2014-09-18T14:53:43  <samson_> I registered with the Thai Bitcoin exchange - they approved it in about 10 minutes
2014-09-18T14:53:51  <RunningmanZ> ok np
2014-09-18T14:54:23  <techbytes-lenovo> ahmed_ let me know when you are done testing
2014-09-18T14:54:34  <samson_> It looks pretty good - I can do an ATM transfer and it should credit instantly - I'll give it a go the next time I pass by an ATM
2014-09-18T14:54:52  <ahmed_> techbytes-lenovo: sure

2014-09-19T04:15:37  <kenel> TTsquared i want to use the escrow to announce a dgc buyback program at spot (when the announcement happens) -15%
2014-09-19T04:15:46  <kenel> even if we buy 0, it'll make people think wtf is going on?
2014-09-19T04:16:00  <kenel> only time buybacks happen is when corporate or the board have something planned
2014-09-19T04:16:05  <TTsquared> Great idea!
2014-09-19T04:26:51  <techbytes-lenovo> TTsquared, RZ has a troll account.  He could approach that guy and pretend to be interested for some other project and maybe will get to take a peek at the wallet setup.
2014-09-19T04:27:22  <TTsquared> Would be interested to know
2014-09-19T04:27:36  <TTsquared> He was asking 20 BTC
2014-09-19T04:28:15  <TTsquared> Kenel, I think he'll blow you off too
2014-09-19T04:28:56  <TTsquared> If you were a serious buyer, I'd be happy to, but since you're not, sorry, I'm not going that route for now.  I also thought about the licensing and am no longer interested in pursuing that either.  As a heads up, it's questionably legal to run a wallet service in the US without being a licensed MSB, which was why I asked (simply because it's possible to receive funds from one user and withdraw them to another).  See
2014-09-19T04:29:17  <RunningmanZ> I have Jutsice4all that i used to troll BCX with but not sure if Clapy knows that
2014-09-19T04:29:22  <RunningmanZ> Justice4all*
2014-09-19T04:30:04  <TTsquared> This is what he sent me when I said I was with the Digitalcoin Foundation and that I'd be interested in licensing it.
2014-09-19T04:30:33  <TTsquared> But initially he was talking to me.
2014-09-19T04:30:48  <RunningmanZ> I'm pretty pissed off how he left tho. No mater how bad things are you don't just disappear like that unless he has a very good reason. I was pretty close with him for quite a while
2014-09-19T04:31:04  <RunningmanZ> Used to talk everyday about anything and everything
2014-09-19T04:31:11  <RunningmanZ> Pretty much
2014-09-19T04:32:08  <RunningmanZ> Would be good to somehow get some screenhots by using a fake buyer account. That would prove if its him
2014-09-19T04:32:21  <RunningmanZ> Unless he has already changed it alot
2014-09-19T04:32:26  <TTsquared> I noticed this person has just a few posts about nothing, then this one selling the software, then nothing more.
2014-09-19T04:33:34  <TTsquared> About 5 PMs then that last one after I mentioned the Foundation
2014-09-19T04:34:39  <RunningmanZ> "Closed demos available for seriously interested parties."
2014-09-19T04:39:22  <techbytes-lenovo> regarding trenal online wallet, if we are to use it, we are going to have it on the foundation server right?
2014-09-19T04:40:21  <TTsquared> Well, maybe a seperate, foundation controlled server
2014-09-19T04:40:48  <techbytes-lenovo> that's fine... as long as it's under the foundation control
2014-09-19T04:42:16  <TTsquared> I'd really like to do something special
2014-09-19T04:43:03  <TTsquared> I'd like the foundation to offer a DGC only online wallet
2014-09-19T04:43:09  <TTsquared> No fees
2014-09-19T04:43:21  <TTsquared> And insured deposits
2014-09-19T04:47:40  <TTsquared> We need something really nice though

2014-09-19T04:48:17  <TTsquared> Unfortunately I think Trenal has a ways to go yet.
2014-09-19T04:49:05  <TTsquared> Can't do something like that without features like that person is talking about in that post
2014-09-19T04:49:16  <techbytes-lenovo> it's a good idea except the insurance part.  It's a great pitch but it will also invite all the hackers to come and steal our coins.
2014-09-19T04:49:55  <TTsquared> Why would it make hackers any more interested!
2014-09-19T04:49:59  <TTsquared> .
2014-09-19T04:50:06  <TTsquared> ?
2014-09-19T04:50:21  <techbytes-lenovo> if users don't expect to have their coins insure, why give it to them?
2014-09-19T04:51:02  <techbytes-lenovo> nvm... i'm still thinking users in the cryptoworld
2014-09-19T04:51:14  <TTsquared> Exactly
2014-09-19T04:51:49  <TTsquared> I have 400 users that I will be responsible for one way or another
2014-09-19T04:52:37  <TTsquared> No choice
2014-09-19T04:52:41  <techbytes-lenovo> yeah
2014-09-19T04:53:21  <TTsquared> So it has to be rock solid, and only trusted individuals with back end access
2014-09-19T04:54:48  <TTsquared> We must start to appeal to the general public, and they expect a site like that to be accountable for their funds
2014-09-19T04:55:44  <TTsquared> I've been thinking about this for quite a while now
2014-09-19T04:56:15  <TTsquared> Registered DCDIC.com and .net a few months ago
2014-09-19T04:56:50  <TTsquared> Digitalcoin Deposit Insurance Corporation
2014-09-19T04:57:20  <TTsquared> Or Digital Currency Deposit Insurance Corporation
2014-09-19T04:57:43  <TTsquared> Just like FDIC but for crypto
2014-09-19T04:58:00  <kenel> "fuck you government"
2014-09-19T04:59:06  <TTsquared> Well, nobody in crypto wants to accept any accountability
2014-09-19T04:59:30  <TTsquared> I want to change that and set a standard
2014-09-19T05:00:00  <kenel> i'm fully behind that theory
2014-09-19T05:00:13  <kenel> and i know this is true because most of bcx's threats, for example, are
2014-09-19T05:00:26  <kenel> "You need to release your personal information and i won't attack your coin"
2014-09-19T05:02:13  <TTsquared> Well, think about it. Would people trust your business if you refused to tell them your name?
2014-09-19T05:02:24  <kenel> No, but you an I live in a real business world
2014-09-19T05:02:29  <kenel> most of crypto is people in college
2014-09-19T05:02:31  <kenel> they have no idea
2014-09-19T05:03:07  <TTsquared> Right, but that's like .001% of the population
2014-09-19T05:03:19  <kenel> of course, but it's like 90% of the crypto population
2014-09-19T05:03:25  <TTsquared> I'm thinking about all the rest
2014-09-19T05:06:00  <techbytes-lenovo> maybe this is a question for ahmed, would be nice to have multisig for the online wallet if it is doable.  Like bitgo.com
2014-09-19T05:06:56  <TTsquared> That page gives an error for me
2014-09-19T05:07:29  <TTsquared> " This webpage has a redirect loop "
2014-09-19T05:07:50  <TTsquared> But I know what you mean
2014-09-19T05:08:18  <techbytes-lenovo> yeah, they don't know how to setup their site... http://www.bitgo.com
2014-09-19T05:08:18  <TTsquared> And yes, that would be a fantastic feature

2014-09-19T18:15:31  <ahmed_> techbytes: it is
2014-09-19T18:15:41  <ahmed_> its been rebuilt now though by other people
2014-09-19T18:16:15  <ahmed_> unsure if theyre still using sucky PHP though
2014-09-19T18:22:39  <techbytes> other people = new identities?
2014-09-19T18:24:19  <ahmed_> other people as in genuinely other people
2014-09-19T18:24:31  <kenel-work2> Hello Kenel,
2014-09-19T18:24:32  <kenel-work2> Sorry for my busy-ness. I can transfer you the site Saturday and will be in IRC so we can chat. Does that work for you?
2014-09-19T18:24:34  <ahmed_> (the ones i know of are broketech and Raziel420)
2014-09-19T18:24:37  <kenel-work2> i won't be around on saturday
2014-09-19T18:24:40  <kenel-work2> it's our customer day

2014-09-19T18:28:21  <xawksow> i try to be here

2014-09-19T18:36:01  <techbytes> sha algo is running smoothly... i'm going to try pointing 100mh at x11 algo for a day or two.  we know scrypt is running fine.
2014-09-19T18:43:23  <techbytes> cosmo syscoin pump still going.
2014-09-19T18:50:21  <techbytes> just realized after i rented x11 hash that they use stratum so it can't connect to dgcv3...
2014-09-19T18:54:57  <cosmo> guess i shoulda bought in
2014-09-19T18:56:40  <techbytes> waiting to get even to dump some for dgc.
2014-09-19T18:57:55  <cosmo> went up to 450, what was the ipo price
2014-09-19T19:00:20  <techbytes> 550 and 580 iirc

2014-09-19T19:30:07  <cosmo> are they still going off that block reward scheme?
2014-09-19T19:30:32  <cosmo> ~100k coins a day for the next three years
2014-09-19T19:31:15  <techbytes> that's not a whole lot for the price support.
2014-09-19T19:31:50  <cosmo> i dunno
2014-09-19T19:32:08  <cosmo> i don't see the incentive to keep the price up if it's gonna get eaten away from miners
2014-09-19T19:33:38  <techbytes> well, value is from what they bring to the coin.  So i'll just hang on to some and see where it goes.
2014-09-19T19:34:50  <techbytes> dgc is so undervalue right now knowing total supply will by cut by 60%...
2014-09-19T19:35:15  <cosmo> lol i'm clueless
2014-09-19T19:35:20  <cosmo> we need some kind of marketing gag
2014-09-19T19:35:31  <cosmo> or not
2014-09-19T19:35:33  <cosmo> idk
2014-09-19T19:36:34  <techbytes> well, kenel and TT are doing that at hasherunited... it's a start.
2014-09-19T19:36:57  <cosmo> it's just my issue, i'm not used to pennystocking yet
2014-09-19T19:38:55  <cosmo> i aint ruthless enough to trade successfully
2014-09-19T19:39:29  <cosmo> just thought 'wow crypto is a far better alternative to fiat i wanna get involved with this' and wound up here since dgc was the first well-done, fair start coin
2014-09-19T19:39:40  <cosmo> shmeh
2014-09-19T19:39:57  <cosmo> i'll have to be getting a job someday, maybe then i'll learn
2014-09-19T19:42:10  <techbytes> first coin i got involved in was chinacoin.. made 6 btc but got scam for 4 btc.  Probably from the same guy with shill accounts.  That was my first exchange on the forum.
2014-09-19T19:42:57  <techbytes> i was the idiot who sent first, twice...
2014-09-19T19:43:30  <cosmo> lol i did that too, with some old runescape item
2014-09-19T19:43:40  <cosmo> back when btc was ten bucks i tried to sell it for 5
2014-09-19T19:44:04  <cosmo> guy had done previous trades so i figured it'd work, nope
2014-09-19T19:44:29  <cosmo> other than that, SR took 5btc from me :(
2014-09-19T19:44:48  <techbytes> silkroad?
2014-09-19T19:45:24  <cosmo> that is one word that fits the acronym, yes
2014-09-19T19:45:31  <techbytes> bbl, picking up the kids...
2014-09-19T19:46:08  <cosmo> mmk
2014-09-19T20:38:42  <cosmo> oh techbytes, looks like checkcoin didn't extend the ico
2014-09-19T21:20:25  <samson_> WTF
2014-09-19T21:20:29  <samson_> www.cryptsy.com uses an invalid security certificate. The certificate is not trusted because no issuer chain was provided. (Error code: sec_error_unknown_issuer)
2014-09-19T21:20:43  <samson_> Anyone getting errors on Cryptsy ?
2014-09-19T21:23:33  <cosmo> yeah, i got the same error
2014-09-19T21:25:24  <samson_> looks like they haven't configured ssl properly
2014-09-19T21:26:01  <cosmo> looks like it's back up now?
2014-09-19T21:26:04  <samson_> or they are currently configuring it, you normally get a 'chain' along with the certificate
2014-09-19T21:26:17  <samson_> yes
2014-09-19T21:26:27  <samson_> They must have been doing some server maintenance
2014-09-19T21:28:58  <samson_> Yes, new SSL certificate issued today
2014-09-19T21:31:04  <cosmo> let's trade 100k dgc between each other
2014-09-19T21:34:23  <samson_> sure, just sell into my bid and I'll add another one
2014-09-19T21:34:25  <samson_> lol
2014-09-19T21:35:26  <cosmo> OKAY
2014-09-19T21:36:14  <samson_> I now have an easy and almost instant way to buy BTC here in Thailand, I send a payment direct to the exchange from the ATM and it credits my account
2014-09-19T21:37:14  <cosmo> that's pretty cool
2014-09-19T21:37:28  <cosmo> i haven't bought btc with fiat in a while
2014-09-19T21:37:51  <samson_> Yes, there's an approximate $1000 per day limit on ATM transfers though
2014-09-19T21:38:16  <samson_> 30,000 Thai Baht a go
2014-09-19T21:39:14  <cosmo> are you putting a % of your income directly to crypto?
2014-09-19T21:40:00  <samson_> No, until about a month ago I hadn't spent any fiat on crypto for over a year
2014-09-19T21:40:41  <samson_> maybe two months ago,  I cought a couple off some guy I do some work for
2014-09-19T21:40:47  <samson_> *bought
2014-09-19T21:41:00  <cosmo> are you the asshole putting your buy one sat over mine
2014-09-19T21:41:18  <samson_> but with prices changing I'm tempted to buy more so I'm buying more :)
2014-09-19T21:42:27  <nilz> samson_ chain is only established if intermediate certificate is installed properly or rootCA is trusted in browser <:
2014-09-19T21:43:39  <nilz> eg the bundle is correct chained <3
2014-09-19T21:43:47  <samson_> Yeah, without that it won't work - I come across it once myself but these days I get someone else to do the ssl - it's so rare they need doing especially when you can just buy a 3 year cert - not worth learning how to do it
2014-09-19T21:44:31  <nilz> comodo positive ssl (8$@namecheap) comes always without intermediate you have to create the bundle on your own
2014-09-19T21:44:57  <samson_> oh really, that would make things harder I think
2014-09-19T21:45:15  <nilz> while some browsers show no error i had some users who get that sec_error_unknown_issuer
2014-09-19T21:45:17  <nilz> <3
2014-09-19T21:45:33  <nilz> took me 30min to find it out yesterday
2014-09-19T21:46:24  <samson_> Godaddy charge $200 for a 3 year basic cert now
2014-09-19T21:46:31  <nilz> :>
2014-09-19T21:46:46  <nilz> yes poistive ssl is just to get "you're having ssl here" :D
2014-09-19T21:47:00  <nilz> would never purchase positive ssl for a store or something like that
2014-09-19T21:48:27  <nilz> nowadays you have a whole bunch of ssl certs
2014-09-19T21:49:54  <samson_> yeah, different levels of verification of who you are, etc
2014-09-19T21:49:59  <samson_> The whole thing's a scam
2014-09-19T21:52:08  <nilz> well :D

2014-09-19T21:58:09  <kenel-work2> i thought my SSL certs were like 50$ from godaddy
2014-09-19T22:00:26  <nilz> :>
2014-09-19T22:03:34  <samson_> They used to be very cheap, first they lure you in then they hike the prices
2014-09-19T22:04:36  <samson_> An SSL cert based merely on owning the domain name should be very cheap
2014-09-19T22:04:50  <samson_> especially if it's your registrar who's selling it to you
2014-09-19T22:05:00  <kenel-work2> yeah it's 70$/yr
2014-09-19T22:05:31  <samson_> $10 would be more like it
2014-09-19T22:05:50  <samson_> I think they were about $10 a year a few years back
2014-09-19T22:06:12  <nilz> some years ago you got a free ssl cert on top of your domain @ namecheap
2014-09-19T22:06:27  <nilz> never used godaddy
2014-09-19T22:06:56  <kenel-work2> 42 coin is still around?
2014-09-19T22:15:57  <kenel-work2> neilm got back to me
2014-09-19T22:16:02  <kenel-work2> going to see how much he wants for his wallet

2014-09-19T23:42:30  <samson_> I live in Thailand now
2014-09-19T23:44:34  <nilz> wow thats far away :D

2014-09-19T23:46:06  <ahmed_> samson_: where in england?
2014-09-19T23:46:16  <samson_> Coventry
2014-09-19T23:46:24  <ahmed_> ahh preston, lancs here
2014-09-19T23:48:13  <samson_> Thailand's a pretty good place, I'd been a few times on holiday before and I liked it so I kind of partially moved here a few months at a time on and off for a few years then just moved completely when things in the UK got boring
2014-09-19T23:48:38  <ahmed_> heh no disagreements there. UK is shit xD
2014-09-19T23:49:09  <samson_> Coventry has to be one of the most boring places there, small and quiet. It got worse over the years so I left, again
2014-09-19T23:49:31  <ahmed_> yeah i bet
2014-09-19T23:49:36  <ahmed_> i hate small and quiet places
2014-09-19T23:49:49  <ahmed_> essentially ghost townsa
2014-09-19T23:49:54  <samson_> Well I moved to Bangkok which was the opposite
2014-09-19T23:50:04  <samson_> But I got fed up with that so I moved to a small and quiet place
2014-09-19T23:50:05  <samson_> lol
2014-09-19T23:50:36  <ahmed_> LOL
2014-09-19T23:50:58  <ahmed_> samson_: just admit it. you liked being away from the UK too much :D
2014-09-19T23:51:03  <samson_> I'll get bored again in the future no doubt and move somewhere else probably within Thailand at some point in the future
2014-09-19T23:51:08  <samson_> Yeah, the UK sucks
2014-09-19T23:51:50  <samson_> I haven't been there for about two and a half years and that was only for 5 days, previous to that I was away for another 18 months
2014-09-19T23:52:10  <ahmed_> wow damn
2014-09-19T23:52:13  <samson_> So I've been in the UK for 5 days in the last 4 years

2014-09-20T15:00:36  <samson_> I've been thinking about the data storage in the blockchain system and how it might be used to disable illegal images or other material being posted and then readily accessible by anyone
2014-09-20T15:01:48  <samson_> I wonder if the data could be encrypted using AES256 with a key / derived IV based on the input address
2014-09-20T15:02:15  <samson_> It would still be abailable to anyone but you would have to go looking for it which is very different to just storing it
2014-09-20T15:02:23  <samson_> Just a thought
2014-09-20T15:05:10  <xawksow> well you just need to look from which address the transaction came from
2014-09-20T15:05:12  <xawksow> and then encrypt it
2014-09-20T15:05:28  <xawksow> i don't see the advantage, as you could write a tool which does that automatically
2014-09-20T15:05:30  <samson_> yes, or the destination address even
2014-09-20T15:05:52  <samson_> The advantage is that if someone puts something illegal in there normal users who don't go looking for it will be protected
2014-09-20T15:06:26  <samson_> it will still be there but without special tools to access it it's just raw data
2014-09-20T15:06:39  <xawksow> mhh
2014-09-20T15:06:55  <xawksow> i will think about that
2014-09-20T15:07:01  <samson_> There are some unuaul laws on some countries - posession = guilt - no exceptions
2014-09-20T15:07:11  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-20T15:07:21  <xawksow> i don't say we should not encrypt it
2014-09-20T15:08:30  <xawksow> why not randomly encrypt it?
2014-09-20T15:08:41  <xawksow> and pass the key if you want to see the content
2014-09-20T15:09:14  <samson_> takes up more space and then you have a key infrastructure issue
2014-09-20T15:09:28  <samson_> I think - unless the key is also added
2014-09-20T15:09:59  <xawksow> a key infrastructure issue?
2014-09-20T15:10:17  <xawksow> if the wallet got a list of your own blocks + encryption key
2014-09-20T15:10:32  <xawksow> you can pass the key to someone who wants to check the content
2014-09-20T15:10:36  <samson_> There is a law in the UK which says it's illegal to posess a gun. If you find a gun lying on the street and take it to a police station they will arrest you and the punishment for this 'crime' is 5 years in prison - minimum
2014-09-20T15:10:53  <samson_> How does that allow me to put something in the transaction which anyone can read ?
2014-09-20T15:11:17  <samson_> Like a proof of existence - just a hash that existed at a certain block creation time
2014-09-20T15:11:38  <samson_> This is why I suggested using something common to the transaction as the key, it's obfuscation
2014-09-20T15:12:36  <samson_> The laws for illegal images are similar to the gun laws - there's a legal term for it but I've forgotten what they call it - I think it was something like 'mutually exclusive' or similar
2014-09-20T15:13:56  <xawksow> hm
2014-09-20T15:13:58  <xawksow> i got some more ideas
2014-09-20T15:14:06  <xawksow> but need to go now for an hour or two
2014-09-20T15:14:11  <xawksow> we'll talk later further about it.
2014-09-20T15:14:15  <samson_> ok, cool
2014-09-20T15:14:21  <xawksow> <3
2014-09-20T15:14:32  <samson_> I'd hate someone to attack the chain by loading it up with porn for example
2014-09-20T15:14:53  <xawksow> yea that's true
2014-09-20T15:15:18  <samson_> I've found the legal term  Iwas talking about - it's known as "strict liability"
2014-09-20T15:15:24  <samson_> There is no excuse, ever
2014-09-20T15:20:40  <nilz> <3

2014-09-20T15:21:51  <nilz> or vice versa
2014-09-20T16:00:26  <ahmed_> samson_: xawksow simple
2014-09-20T16:00:33  <ahmed_> you should be able to use an address's public key
2014-09-20T16:00:56  <ahmed_> that way you'd have to have contact with the distributer or something
2014-09-20T16:01:21  <samson_> hmm, I'm wonndering how that would work if I wantd to create something like mastercoin on top of the blockchain
2014-09-20T16:01:34  <samson_> everyone would need to be able to view the decrypted data
2014-09-20T16:02:08  <samson_> same as a proof of existence, I would just insert a document hash for that usage
2014-09-20T16:02:26  <samson_> but at the same time as making it easily readable I'd like to prevent abuse
2014-09-20T16:03:03  <samson_> or easy abuse
2014-09-20T16:03:08  <ahmed_> hmm
2014-09-20T16:03:12  <ahmed_> that'd be difficult then
2014-09-20T16:03:59  <samson_> My idea was that if the data is obfuscated in some way something malicious would not appear to be malicious and would take extra steps by the end user to access the malicious data
2014-09-20T16:04:42  <ahmed_> samson_: but then how do you obfuscate it while making it publically viewable
2014-09-20T16:04:45  <samson_> Obfuscation in the example I gave was AES encryption using something related to the transaction - so anyone could decrypt it but that was just an example
2014-09-20T16:05:11  <samson_> You could derive the key from the address the transaction is being sent to
2014-09-20T16:05:16  <ahmed_> possible
2014-09-20T16:05:35  <samson_> Yes, derive key/IV from payto address then it's all available
2014-09-20T16:05:44  <samson_> But to access it you would need to process it
2014-09-20T16:06:13  <kenel> ok

2014-09-20T16:06:45  <samson_> WTF - I thought he wanted 10 BTC to start with !
2014-09-20T16:06:53  <samson_> How can he triple it ?
2014-09-20T16:07:01  <kenel> lol, who said 10 btc? ttsquared?
2014-09-20T16:07:18  <samson_> not sure, but I read it here yesterday....I think
2014-09-20T16:07:30  <kenel> i thought you were the one that said 10btc?
2014-09-20T16:08:08  <samson_> Ah, I was referencing something Ahmed said about some other software - my mistake !
2014-09-20T16:08:42  <samson_> So that's $12000+
2014-09-20T16:08:49  <kenel> yeah
2014-09-20T16:09:03  <samson_> Have you seen it ? What's it written in ?
2014-09-20T16:09:05  <kenel> but i at least have him talking to me
2014-09-20T16:09:16  <kenel> he said he'd setup a private demo
2014-09-20T16:09:28  <kenel> we could make our own wallet for that price....

2014-09-20T16:11:40  <kenel> the kid went to a midwest ivy league college; he overvalues himself and his creations
2014-09-20T16:11:50  <samson_> Is it just a frontend to a daemon or some kind of offline cold storage engine

2014-09-20T16:12:43  <kenel> well TTsquared i just got a response on the price the guy's looking for for that wallet
2014-09-20T16:12:52  <TTsquared> And?
2014-09-20T16:12:56  <kenel> 30btc
2014-09-20T16:13:08  <ahmed_> 30BTC??? for a fucking wallet system
2014-09-20T16:13:16  <TTsquared> He told me at least 20
2014-09-20T16:13:18  <kenel> coffee would've sprayed all over my monitor if i was still drinking it
2014-09-20T16:13:21  <samson_> yeah, it must be something real special to want that price
2014-09-20T16:13:40  <ahmed_> kenel: what does this wallet system do specifically?
2014-09-20T16:13:42  <kenel> the kid lives about 20 miles north of me in the city
2014-09-20T16:13:57  <kenel> don't know; i could play along and get a private demo
2014-09-20T16:14:11  <ahmed_> kenel: do it. and note down all the "features"
2014-09-20T16:14:12  <kenel> for 30btc we could make our own.....
2014-09-20T16:14:22  <ahmed_> for 5 btc we could make our own haha

2014-09-20T16:14:30  <samson_> If however he's implemented a full offline cold storage system that just spits out raw transactions to unused addresses and security is distributed across multiple servers then it could be worth something
2014-09-20T16:14:32  <ahmed_> there's already open-source python(flask) based wallet's on github
2014-09-20T16:14:50  <samson_> Are they just frontends to a daemon though ?
2014-09-20T16:15:02  <ahmed_> samson_: a full offline cold storage system still requires some access to private key's
2014-09-20T16:15:10  <kenel> it'd be afraid to use an open source wallet for what we proposed to do on our last call
2014-09-20T16:15:10  <ahmed_> in some form or another
2014-09-20T16:15:16  <samson_> I know but they never need to go into a daemon
2014-09-20T16:15:35  <kenel> hey ahmed_ how are we looking for 3.0? had a busy week this week, didn't keep up in the chat with any updates
2014-09-20T16:15:37  <ahmed_> kenel: yeah i'd be rewriting it myself if i was ever to do it (i build the pool and stuff in python(flask)
2014-09-20T16:16:01  <ahmed_> kenel: the multi algo shits been coded and finished
2014-09-20T16:16:08  <kenel> tested?
2014-09-20T16:16:10  <ahmed_> techbytes-lenovo: spent his time doing testing on all the algorithms
2014-09-20T16:16:27  <samson_> cool, did it all work out as expected ?
2014-09-20T16:16:27  <kenel> awesome, so what's left?
2014-09-20T16:17:00  <ahmed_> any UI modification's, blockchain data storage, updating to latest BTC base
2014-09-20T16:17:22  <kenel> are you building the windows qt?
2014-09-20T16:17:27  <kenel> or do we need someone else to do that?
2014-09-20T16:17:45  <TTsquared> Thought xawksow was on the wallet
2014-09-20T16:17:46  <kenel> baritus is supposed to be around today to transfer files
2014-09-20T16:18:07  <kenel> he's usually here by now, so i don't know
2014-09-20T16:18:17  <kenel> i'll be gone almost all day -- today is our customer day at the office
2014-09-20T16:18:23  <techbytes-lenovo> kenel, update the new ANN and add bittrex to exchange list
2014-09-20T16:18:45  <kenel> don't tell me what to do, now i will do the opposite
2014-09-20T16:18:47  <kenel> !
2014-09-20T16:19:19  <techbytes-lenovo> ha... do it before i reply to this ahole at the old ANN thread
2014-09-20T16:19:39  <samson_> yeah, somsone called us out for not having a link
2014-09-20T16:19:53  <TTsquared> Had to restrain myself too
2014-09-20T16:20:08  <ahmed_> kenel: xawksow was attempting it
2014-09-20T16:20:15  <techbytes-lenovo> that's why i want the link in place at the new ANN before replying
2014-09-20T16:20:17  <ahmed_> but i can get shakezula or someone to do it for a fee
2014-09-20T16:20:28  <kenel> link is there now
2014-09-20T16:20:32  <techbytes-lenovo> ok.
2014-09-20T16:20:37  <TTsquared> So how about this kenel, update the OP, please.
2014-09-20T16:20:43  <TTsquared> Oh
2014-09-20T16:20:57  <techbytes-lenovo> how about tonokip for windows qt?
2014-09-20T16:20:57  <samson_> Perhaps Baritus can update the old ANN thread with a link to the new one

2014-09-20T16:24:31  <kenel> he's not on irc right now
2014-09-20T16:25:44  <TTsquared> Who is that kenel?
2014-09-20T16:25:45  <techbytes-lenovo> i saw him last week.  I can reach out to him on bitcointalk
2014-09-20T16:25:49  <kenel> tonokip
2014-09-20T16:26:04  <techbytes-lenovo> he will do it for a small dgc donation
2014-09-20T16:26:54  <TTsquared> Should give xawksow a chance though. Seems like he wants to try it.
2014-09-20T16:27:21  <TTsquared> Unless he would rather not
2014-09-20T16:27:33  <kenel> oh i'm not saying rule out xawksow if he wants to give it a shot, let him do it
2014-09-20T16:28:31  <techbytes-lenovo> well, tonokip can be our last resort...
2014-09-20T16:28:47  <samson_> I bought a couple of hardware random number generators recently
2014-09-20T16:29:04  <techbytes-lenovo> for?
2014-09-20T16:29:06  <TTsquared> So ahmed_, xawksow says these suckers were about to give a scammer .5 BTC and you saved them
2014-09-20T16:29:13  <samson_> testing really
2014-09-20T16:29:19  <techbytes-lenovo> yeah, i was about to send the btc
2014-09-20T16:29:46  <techbytes-lenovo> was just excited and wasn't even thinking about the scam.
2014-09-20T16:30:15  <ahmed_> TTsquared: yeah a few months back when me and tech started running pools most of the pool/exchange/service operators made a chan where we tried to get rid of these scamcoins
2014-09-20T16:30:31  <kenel> from now on any communication with bittrex should be verified via chiznitz or richie
2014-09-20T16:30:38  <ahmed_> and ive had a grudge against bittrex-ritchie for months for helping the scammer
2014-09-20T16:30:45  <kenel> richie's in our fantasy football league
2014-09-20T16:30:55  <ahmed_> so thats why i asked him why they we're charging to list us which is how i found out
2014-09-20T16:31:19  <ahmed_> (and thats why DGC got listed :D)
2014-09-20T16:31:47  <TTsquared> Still have a grudge or cool with them now ahmed_?
2014-09-20T16:32:05  <ahmed_> TTsquared: cool(ish)
2014-09-20T16:32:16  <TTsquared> Fair enough
2014-09-20T16:32:25  <ahmed_> the shitcoin fest's definitely slowed down
2014-09-20T16:32:30  <ahmed_> dedicatedpool's almost dead
2014-09-20T16:32:31  <kenel> is bittrex going to be in vegas ahmed_
2014-09-20T16:32:33  <ahmed_> so its all good
2014-09-20T16:32:41  <ahmed_> kenel: not that im aware of no
2014-09-20T16:33:19  <techbytes-lenovo> no wonder i don't see dedicatedpool putting up pools anymore
2014-09-20T16:34:30  <ahmed_> techbytes-lenovo: binaryclock(aka the 2faced, 2 timing scammer) had been awol for a month
2014-09-20T16:35:11  <TTsquared> I was just checking in, and would love to stay and chat but have to run some errands. Please add any topics to the new meeting post. I'll be back later.

2014-09-20T16:49:27  <ahmed_> that way we get the least orphans while multipool's get more

2014-09-20T16:57:54  <ahmed_> xawksow: agreed, decreasing the effect of multipool's
2014-09-20T16:58:12  <ahmed_> xawksow: how much work do you think it'd take to convert the relaynode to DGC?
2014-09-20T16:59:02  <ahmed_> it uses bitcoinj i think so we could swap that for digitalcoinj
2014-09-20T17:00:27  <xawksow> i think hashengineering can port the digitalcoinj to fit v3
2014-09-20T17:00:42  <ahmed_> yeah he should be able to
2014-09-20T17:00:47  <xawksow> swapping the two libraries will be easy
2014-09-20T17:00:53  <ahmed_> if he doesnt i could. (using the myriadcoin files)
2014-09-20T17:01:14  <xawksow> ok, sweet
2014-09-20T17:09:17  <RunningmanZ> lol that dickhead on the ANN. If he actually cared about DGC and read our forum or FB page he would know about Bittrexx adding DGC

2014-09-20T18:27:53  <xawksow> samson_, i think we should give the option to encrypt the data storage with AES + random key. if we want to make it public available we will add the key after the data bytes, otherwise it is private and only user who know the key can access it
2014-09-20T18:32:52  <samson_> Yes, sounds reasonable as we could then send public data and private data
2014-09-20T18:33:02  <xawksow> exactly
2014-09-20T18:33:05  <samson_> You mentioned being able to use this to send messages back and forth
2014-09-20T18:33:24  <xawksow> yea probably
2014-09-20T18:33:48  <samson_> Using something like this I think people could send messages to a coin address, if that could be tied into some crypto scheme it could be interesting

2014-09-21T00:35:50  <techbytes-lenovo> yeah... when i moved dgc to nomp stratum, i forgot to shutdown the old stratum so stratum port 3333 was conflicted.

2014-09-21T00:53:56  <ahmed_> i need some type of script (preferably python) which will let me sell X coins at the best price on whatever exchange is most profitable
2014-09-21T01:13:03  <xawksow> well can't be that hard. query every exchange for the coin you want to sell and compare the prices.
2014-09-21T01:13:20  <xawksow> add api keys for every exchange
2014-09-21T01:13:56  <xawksow> create a module for every exchange which implement the same interface
2014-09-21T01:13:58  <xawksow> and profit
2014-09-21T01:16:58  <ahmed_> xawksow: able to help me build one?
2014-09-21T01:17:12  <ahmed_> im short on time since i need this pool built and tested ready for vegas

2014-09-21T12:30:00  <baritus> good, lots of work needed to transform it into a software package
2014-09-21T12:30:27  <xawksow> yea, isn't easy to do that stuff :p
2014-09-21T12:32:55  <xawksow> what about the transfer, you got everything ready for it by now? :]
2014-09-21T12:37:08  <baritus> yeap
2014-09-21T12:37:18  <baritus> techbytes should have everything
2014-09-21T12:37:31  <xawksow> ok perfect.
2014-09-21T12:37:57  <samson_> Baritus - what do you think of this data storage in the blockchain thing for things like messaging, additional protocols (mastercoin et al), proof of existance timestamps, etc ?
2014-09-21T12:39:39  <baritus> though a good concept, most people don't even understand how coins work to begin with, so I'm not sure of its usefulness
2014-09-21T12:40:19  <samson_> They don't need to understand how it works, service providers will do that part - that's the whole point
2014-09-21T12:42:54  <baritus> if service providers existed and used it, yes
2014-09-21T12:43:23  <samson_>  Yes, I'm building a full API to do all of this
2014-09-21T12:44:11  <techbytes-lenovo> xawksow, check your foundation email... everything you need to transfer the domains and databases... :)
2014-09-21T12:44:25  <xawksow> perfect, got it! :D
2014-09-21T12:56:15  <samson_> My API will work with any coin including Bitcoin

2014-09-21T12:57:57  <baritus> I see no reason why it won't work
2014-09-21T13:00:47  <xawksow> hope you won't go directly open source with it. :p
2014-09-21T13:03:11  <samson_> Why ?
2014-09-21T13:03:14  <samson_> That was my plan
2014-09-21T13:03:28  <baritus> I also suggest the foundation create a new github for development
2014-09-21T13:03:42  <baritus> instead of trying to use mine for it
2014-09-21T13:04:00  <samson_> Not only that but all functions are wrapped in DLL's which make all crypto operations available in Xojo which is a bit like the old Visual Basic which was very easy to use
2014-09-21T13:04:36  <samson_> Xojo creates apps for Windows, Linux and Mac and my c programs compile for all of them with the polarssl library so it's full cross platform
2014-09-21T13:04:58  <samson_> The barrier to entry will be very low with this
2014-09-21T13:06:09  <xawksow> we already got a new github, will move everything accordingly
2014-09-21T13:06:26  <xawksow> or maybe ahmed will, we will see
2014-09-21T13:06:51  <baritus> let me know when you have everything transferred and your git setup, at which point I will take down my files and put up a notice to use new git
2014-09-21T13:07:02  <samson_> Baritus: Can you linkk to the new DGC ANN thread on bitcontalk from the old one ?
2014-09-21T13:07:29  <samson_> Some asshat already complained that Bittrex wasn't listed there
2014-09-21T13:07:41  <xawksow> samson_, because we can build up a system and show what it you can do with it. + got the benefit of havin it exclusively for us for a short time
2014-09-21T13:07:56  <baritus> yeah I will just delete my OP and redirect to new thread
2014-09-21T13:08:09  <samson_> ok, I will hold off on releasing it all until it's 'finished' anyway
2014-09-21T13:08:23  <xawksow> ok
2014-09-21T13:08:45  <samson_> Thanks Baritus - it will avoid confusion on the forum - it's bad enough on there anyway
2014-09-21T13:09:34  <baritus> I'll wait until git and websites are fully switched over and shut down the thread and git
2014-09-21T13:10:29  <baritus> cya later :)
2014-09-21T13:10:38  <techbytes-lenovo> thanks...

2014-09-21T13:11:52  <techbytes-lenovo> have fun... :)
2014-09-21T13:12:08  <samson_> ok cool, thanks
2014-09-21T13:12:20  <samson_> I like the idea of different products
2014-09-21T13:12:21  <baritus> the new business plan is this:
2014-09-21T13:12:33  <baritus> Offer a wallet that can be interfaced with any application
2014-09-21T13:12:42  <baritus> Offer an exchange
2014-09-21T13:12:47  <baritus> and Offer payment processing
2014-09-21T13:12:51  <baritus> all 3 as separate software
2014-09-21T13:13:08  <samson_> Yes, sounds good to me
2014-09-21T13:13:23  <baritus> might just have Wallet, Exchange
2014-09-21T13:13:31  <samson_> Somewhere to trade the shares would be good also
2014-09-21T13:13:31  <baritus> and payment processing addon to the exchange
2014-09-21T13:13:55  <samson_> Apparently havelock is the best
2014-09-21T13:14:24  <baritus> sure, will wait until I have a business plan finished, new sales site up, and put it up on there
2014-09-21T13:14:52  <samson_> Ok
2014-09-21T13:15:27  <baritus> I now have 60% of the shares again
2014-09-21T13:15:57  <samson_> I still have 10%
2014-09-21T13:16:37  <baritus> cool
2014-09-21T13:16:54  <baritus> you won't regret it ;)
2014-09-21T13:16:55  <samson_> I will keep these win or lose
2014-09-21T13:17:21  <baritus> it seems in crypto selling shovels is more profitable than digging for sure
2014-09-21T13:17:34  <samson_> However if they are being traded then I will trade them on an exchange
2014-09-21T13:17:58  <samson_> Yes, that's always been the way - so far it's been mining machine makers who provide the tools
2014-09-21T13:17:59  <baritus> yes I would like to re-list shares once the new business is taking shape
2014-09-21T13:18:31  <samson_> Long term though I suspect there will be a huge need for software
2014-09-21T13:18:37  <samson_> reliable software
2014-09-21T13:18:48  <baritus> yeap, this one has been tested live so that's a plus
2014-09-21T13:19:16  <baritus> I will be back later guys :)

2014-09-21T13:23:29  <samson_> It would almost be worth me getting my own coin just for testing things, I could control the whole thing that way

2014-09-21T13:26:08  <samson_> yes, zero possibility of loss due to buggy code
2014-09-21T13:32:33  <techbytes-lenovo> bbiab... dropping the kids off at sunday school...
2014-09-21T13:45:07  <xawksow> :>
2014-09-21T13:45:17  <xawksow> samson_, you want to send messages without creating a transaction?
2014-09-21T13:45:25  <xawksow> directly p2p
2014-09-21T13:46:10  <xawksow> we would need to know where every wallet is and which address belongs to which wallet
2014-09-21T13:46:23  <xawksow> i c some problems there
2014-09-21T13:50:52  <samson_> well it was just a thought
2014-09-21T13:51:04  <samson_> but you wouldn't need to know where anything is
2014-09-21T13:51:13  <samson_> Take a transaction for example
2014-09-21T13:51:24  <samson_> It's broadcast to all online nodes
2014-09-21T13:51:33  <samson_> If any node is listening it will receive it within seconds
2014-09-21T13:51:44  <samson_> every node receives every transaction
2014-09-21T13:51:48  <samson_> already
2014-09-21T13:52:16  <samson_> sending a non transaction message could just do the same
2014-09-21T13:52:39  <samson_> That's the beauty of the 'gossip protocol'
2014-09-21T13:53:04  <samson_> if you're 'listening' you will 'hear' it
2014-09-21T13:54:29  <xawksow> hm
2014-09-21T13:54:52  <xawksow> okay, but couldn't that end pretty fast in a dos of every node? :D
2014-09-21T13:55:05  <samson_> This is how it works now
2014-09-21T13:55:46  <samson_> Those little pop ups that say you have received a new transaction come from the same mechanism - listening to all packets received - they just popup an alert when one matches one of your addresses
2014-09-21T13:56:08  <xawksow> hm
2014-09-21T13:56:09  <xawksow> okay
2014-09-21T13:56:16  <samson_> so sure someone could ddos it just like they could ddos it by sending too many transactions
2014-09-21T13:56:17  <xawksow> then i think we can give it a try
2014-09-21T13:56:41  <samson_> This would require a protocol modification though to accept a message for relay
2014-09-21T13:57:19  <xawksow> yea, sure
2014-09-21T13:57:21  <samson_> It's worth thinking about it as it would enable messaging apps which don't need storage - some things need to be stored forever and some things don'e
2014-09-21T13:57:25  <samson_> *don't
2014-09-21T13:58:01  <xawksow> right
2014-09-21T13:58:05  <xawksow> sounds reasonable to do it
2014-09-21T13:58:14  <samson_> Services could broadcast latest prices using this kind of messsage - Imagine something like the alert key message but for everyone to use differently
2014-09-21T13:58:50  <xawksow> :DDDDD
2014-09-21T13:58:51  <samson_> In fact something similar was being discussed already with regard to price tickers, etc
2014-09-21T13:58:55  <xawksow> i want that
2014-09-21T13:58:57  <samson_> It's just a matter of opening it up
2014-09-21T13:59:20  <xawksow> hm :>
2014-09-21T13:59:25  <xawksow> i will try to implement it into digitalcoinj
2014-09-21T13:59:29  <xawksow> as soon as it is ported to v3
2014-09-21T14:00:20  <samson_> so long as the regular nodes will transmit the message I can see it working, I'm not sure if they will though so it might need a change - Ahmed might know about this

2014-09-21T14:28:51  <xawksow> well i think the digitalcoinj can relay those messages too
2014-09-21T14:28:53  <xawksow> as they need no storage
2014-09-21T14:29:25  <xawksow> for the normal wallets we need some modifications
2014-09-21T14:29:32  <xawksow> but i think that won't be that hard to do
2014-09-21T14:29:34  <samson_> Yes, I think so
2014-09-21T14:29:42  <samson_> It won't require a fork anyway
2014-09-21T14:30:01  <samson_> but it would be good to get small changes like this in before a hard fork as everyone will then have them
2014-09-21T14:30:27  <xawksow> yea sure
2014-09-21T14:30:29  <samson_> even if we just go with basic versions initially then can be modified at a later date
2014-09-21T14:30:42  <samson_> once we've done more extensive testing, etc
2014-09-21T14:31:55  <xawksow> seems like a good idea imo
2014-09-21T14:31:56  <xawksow> <:
2014-09-21T14:32:35  <samson_> Yes, I'm getting competent with the crypto parts of what I'm working with now - so my speed of development is rapidly increasing

2014-09-21T14:36:24  <samson_> Besides this work I don't really have to do much else really so I have plenty of time

2014-09-21T14:42:36  <ahmed_> hows it goin
2014-09-21T14:43:22  <xawksow> good i think :p
2014-09-21T14:43:30  <xawksow> we got many ideas for the blockchain storage api
2014-09-21T14:43:35  <xawksow> and got now the domains from baritus
2014-09-21T14:43:43  <xawksow> + techbytes got github access
2014-09-21T14:44:21  <xawksow> i will not transfer them now
2014-09-21T14:44:27  <xawksow> i'll wait until the meeting is over
2014-09-21T14:44:34  <ahmed_> xawksow: not??? :O
2014-09-21T14:44:41  <ahmed_> but sweet :D
2014-09-21T14:44:44  <xawksow> yea :>
2014-09-21T14:44:46  <kenel> so we have everything?
2014-09-21T14:44:52  <ahmed_> alert keys?
2014-09-21T14:44:59  <kenel> yeah, alert keys?
2014-09-21T14:45:17  <xawksow> i don't got alert keys
2014-09-21T14:45:44  <xawksow> maybe techbytes got them, he spoke directly to him
2014-09-21T14:46:04  <ahmed_> right we need to make sure we got them or our lifes going to be harder
2014-09-21T14:47:00  <xawksow> yea, forgot to ask him
2014-09-21T14:47:01  <xawksow> fuck me
2014-09-21T14:47:22  <xawksow> btw. transferring a domain costs @ namecheap 23$ per domain
2014-09-21T14:47:38  <xawksow> i think that is pretty expensive, does anyone of you got a cheaper registrar?
2014-09-21T14:47:42  <kenel> yeah you're re-registering it there for another year, right?
2014-09-21T14:47:54  <xawksow> i'm not sure, but it could be
2014-09-21T14:48:02  <samson_> yes, any time you transfer a domain you need to pay for an additional year
2014-09-21T14:48:07  <xawksow> meh <_>
2014-09-21T14:48:08  <kenel> can't someone just create an account at name.com where his is
2014-09-21T14:48:12  <samson_> in my experience anyway
2014-09-21T14:48:13  <kenel> and just transfer between users?
2014-09-21T14:48:21  <kenel> should be free
2014-09-21T14:48:55  <kenel> i leveled my character to 7 last night so i'm almost halfway to trolling rawdawg
2014-09-21T14:49:28  <kenel> I have given all the files and domain auth codes to techbytes.
2014-09-21T14:49:29  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-21T14:49:30  <xawksow> hahaha
2014-09-21T14:49:33  <kenel> no alert key
2014-09-21T14:49:40  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-21T14:49:51  <xawksow> he send me the mail with those domains
2014-09-21T14:49:56  <samson_> Baritus said he will be back later so ask him for it then
2014-09-21T14:50:04  <kenel> he never comes back later
2014-09-21T14:50:06  <samson_> He said the same thing last week though and didn't come back for a week

2014-09-21T14:50:31  <xawksow> Ready to bring your Domain to Name.com?
2014-09-21T14:50:31  <xawksow> Transfer now to extend your domain registration by 1 year!*
2014-09-21T14:50:37  <samson_> maybe he meant later in the month...
2014-09-21T14:50:45  <kenel> year*
2014-09-21T14:51:00  <ahmed_> *century
2014-09-21T14:51:07  <kenel> we're at 68 people in digitalcoin now
2014-09-21T14:51:09  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-21T14:51:10  <samson_> If it's already on name.com then it's not a transfer it's an account transfer - same at godaddy - you only need to pay if you're moving registrar I think
2014-09-21T14:51:10  <kenel> guess who's back back back
2014-09-21T14:51:27  <samson_> who ?
2014-09-21T14:51:32  <kenel> 16 more and we beat kassado
2014-09-21T14:51:36  <kenel> back again gain gain

2014-09-21T14:52:15  <xawksow> which can take centuries as ahmed just mentioned
2014-09-21T14:52:16  <kenel> it's not worth waiting
2014-09-21T14:52:20  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-21T14:52:21  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-21T14:52:32  <ahmed_> yep
2014-09-21T14:52:37  <kenel> we can figure it out in a little bit
2014-09-21T14:52:43  <kenel> i have to do a few things for the next few hours
2014-09-21T14:52:43  <kenel> bbl
2014-09-21T14:52:47  <xawksow> kk
2014-09-21T14:52:48  <ahmed_> ive got a namecheap account
2014-09-21T14:52:54  <ahmed_> ill just pay the $23
2014-09-21T14:52:57  <xawksow> yea me too
2014-09-21T14:53:01  <kenel> i have one with other foundation names
2014-09-21T14:53:03  <xawksow> but we got 4 domains to be transfered
2014-09-21T14:53:41  <ahmed_> xawksow: which 4 domains?
2014-09-21T14:53:54  <xawksow> digitalcoin.co
2014-09-21T14:53:54  <xawksow> digiclick.co
2014-09-21T14:53:54  <xawksow> argcurrency.org
2014-09-21T14:53:54  <xawksow> securecoin.org
2014-09-21T14:54:01  <ahmed_> oh
2014-09-21T14:54:06  <ahmed_> so $23 each/
2014-09-21T14:54:10  <xawksow> yea :/
2014-09-21T14:54:14  <ahmed_> that sucks
2014-09-21T14:54:20  <xawksow> that is my problem. i would have done it already for digitalcoin.co
2014-09-21T14:54:30  <ahmed_> so lets split the cost?
2014-09-21T14:54:38  <xawksow> but as that is a bit more expensive, i think we should talk about it @ the meeting
2014-09-21T14:54:46  <xawksow> yea probably a good idea to split
2014-09-21T14:55:29  <xawksow> and we need to be aware of a down time
2014-09-21T14:55:43  <xawksow> if we transfer them right away without having the host records set right
2014-09-21T14:56:07  <ahmed_> yep definitely
2014-09-21T14:56:14  <xawksow> i will put everything of the main site + forum @ the foundation server
2014-09-21T14:56:18  <xawksow> and set vhosts correct
2014-09-21T14:56:19  <ahmed_> but we cant set the host records right now can we?
2014-09-21T14:56:29  <xawksow> nop we can't
2014-09-21T14:56:39  <xawksow> therefor we need it transfered to our account
2014-09-21T14:56:48  <xawksow> but that can take 3 to 8 days
2014-09-21T14:57:14  <xawksow> btw i'm not sure how to proceed with the other websites.
2014-09-21T14:58:42  <ahmed_> we should just set them all up on the foundation server for now
2014-09-21T14:59:12  <ahmed_> transfer them to namecheap
2014-09-21T14:59:19  <samson_> modify the DNS servers so the refresh time is set to something low like 600 seconds or less - this really helps with DNS caching when moving domains - tried and tested many times over the years
2014-09-21T14:59:53  <xawksow> we need it on our accounts to do so
2014-09-21T15:00:01  <xawksow> @ samson_
2014-09-21T15:00:01  <CryptoExpert> xawksow: Error: "samson_" is not a valid command.
2014-09-21T15:00:13  <xawksow> ahmed_, yea i probably will do that
2014-09-21T15:00:20  <ahmed_> xawksow: how about you taking the 2 DGC domains and i'll take the arg and src domain
2014-09-21T15:00:40  <ahmed_> that way we can get it done asap. (im willing to pay the $50)
2014-09-21T15:01:54  <samson_> good point, get Baritus to change the DNS servers on the domains prior to the registrar move
2014-09-21T15:01:54  <xawksow> yea, try to get baritus to do something
2014-09-21T15:01:54  <xawksow> ......
2014-09-21T15:02:07  <xawksow> ahmed_, sounds good to me, but i need to take my girlfriend now home
2014-09-21T15:02:08  <samson_> it's a 10 second job
2014-09-21T15:02:15  <xawksow> will be back in an hour
2014-09-21T15:02:21  <ahmed_> xawksow: sure
2014-09-21T15:02:26  <ahmed_> samson_: problem is
2014-09-21T15:02:30  <ahmed_> whats a 10 sec job for us
2014-09-21T15:02:35  <ahmed_> is a 10 day job for baritus
2014-09-21T15:02:39  <samson_> lol
2014-09-21T15:02:42  <xawksow> so true
2014-09-21T15:02:43  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-21T15:02:43  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-21T15:03:12  <ahmed_> sad but true :/
2014-09-21T15:11:38  <samson_> Did anyone ever consider adding another type of agorithm with a zero coinbase, just transaction fees ? Perhaps something that could be mined by the clients to keep things going if the difficulty became too high if the coin was under attack ?
2014-09-21T15:13:51  <ahmed_> samson_: i dont think that'd be possible
2014-09-21T15:14:58  <samson_> maybe if the block could only be mined after a certain amount of time without any main algorithm blocks being mined ?
2014-09-21T15:15:08  <samson_> a kind of fallback
2014-09-21T15:15:19  <samson_> maybe not possible but just an idea
2014-09-21T15:15:28  <ahmed_> i dont think that'd work really
2014-09-21T15:15:38  <ahmed_> cause itd be no different to mining a normal block
2014-09-21T15:15:58  <samson_> true but there would be less incentive to hijack them
2014-09-21T15:16:07  <samson_> due to no rewards
2014-09-21T15:16:19  <ahmed_> yeah but a normal block cant be hijacked
2014-09-21T15:16:37  <ahmed_> since blocks and transactions are validated
2014-09-21T15:17:01  <samson_> I'm referring to someone coming on with massive hash so the difficulty goes so high we're waiting an hour for a block to be confirmed
2014-09-21T15:17:10  <samson_> after they leave
2014-09-21T15:17:21  <ahmed_> yeah but the likelihood of that isnt very big
2014-09-21T15:17:28  <ahmed_> since a) we're retargeting every block
2014-09-21T15:17:28  <samson_> I guess they could also do the same to any fallback mining as well
2014-09-21T15:17:37  <ahmed_> b) ^ they could
2014-09-21T15:17:48  <ahmed_> c) theres only so big of a increase allowance
2014-09-21T15:17:53  <ahmed_> so theyd be wasting money

2014-09-21T19:35:46  <kenel> ahmed
2014-09-21T19:35:56  <kenel> ahmed_ this was baritus' response for the alert keys: I have not been able to find where I stored them yet. Ahmed can set new key requirements in the V3.0 hard fork.
2014-09-21T19:36:09  <samson_> Ok
2014-09-21T19:36:32  <xawksow> but if we don't get them, the v2 wallets won'T get that message, right?
2014-09-21T19:36:38  <kenel> right
2014-09-21T19:36:46  <xawksow> man that sucks.#
2014-09-21T19:37:10  <samson_> Ahmed, you mentioned that p2p messages can be broadcast into the network using the standard messaging sructures at this link : https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Network#Messages

2014-09-21T19:38:45  <kenel> who is dude :P
2014-09-21T19:39:15  <xawksow> duuuuuude

2014-09-21T19:39:30  <xawksow> i opened up a stratum port just for his powerful asics
2014-09-21T19:39:31  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-21T19:40:01  <kenel> i didn't realize he had that much hash
2014-09-21T19:40:20  <xawksow> i think he got up to 1GH/s
2014-09-21T19:40:27  <kenel> well damn
2014-09-21T19:40:33  <xawksow> first he showed +500
2014-09-21T19:40:48  <xawksow> today he is again there with +600
2014-09-21T19:41:11  <xawksow> and i think he said somethin about +900 he got

2014-09-21T19:45:43  <xawksow> we are now close to 2gh/ss
2014-09-21T19:51:47  <samson_> Regarding alerts I found this : Alerts are cryptographically signed by a public key. The corresponding private key is held by a few selected members of the core development team. The digital signature ensures that fake alerts will not be propagated on the network.
2014-09-21T19:52:37  <samson_> So unless the alert message is signed by the correct key it won't be propogated, let alone acted upon so any message protocol could not use this without the alert key
2014-09-21T19:54:13  <samson_> That comes from a pre published copy of the 'Mastering Bitcoin' book which I purchased - it hasn't been proofread yet otherwise I suspect it would say signed by a private key

2014-09-21T19:57:44  <xawksow> yea, because the diff is now pretty high
2014-09-21T19:57:49  <xawksow> and not profitable for him anymore

2014-09-21T19:58:16  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-21T19:58:33  <kenel> you should set it up that anyone that uses the goddamn asic port has a fee
2014-09-21T19:58:45  <kenel> ;P
2014-09-21T19:58:51  <xawksow> i think that can't be done that easily xD
2014-09-21T19:59:08  <kenel> well get it done by 18pm
2014-09-21T19:59:41  <kenel> and yeah, i know it can't, but i'm thinking these asic owners with huge mh/s or gh/s won't care about a small fee
2014-09-21T19:59:55  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-21T20:03:03  <kenel> hey techbytes techbytes-lenovo i can't get the philly game here
2014-09-21T20:03:03  <kenel> what's up with mccoy?
2014-09-21T20:04:11  <ahmed_> samson_: with our custom alert feature we can send out messages in any way we want
2014-09-21T20:05:24  <kenel> ahmed_ i think baritus lost the keys or didn't save them
2014-09-21T20:05:54  <ahmed_> kenel: or doesnt want to give them
2014-09-21T20:06:24  <kenel> eh, i don't see any malintent from baritus like that so far
2014-09-21T20:06:24  <kenel> i don't think he'd hold them back if he could find them or has them
2014-09-21T20:07:01  <ahmed_> kenel: he said he had them and hed get them to us ages ago
2014-09-21T20:07:07  <ahmed_> and its not exactly difficult
2014-09-21T20:08:32  <ahmed_> oh well
2014-09-21T20:08:38  <ahmed_> guess more work for us then
2014-09-21T20:12:24  <samson_> ahmed: Ok, the custom alert sounds interesting - is this already in place or is it something for DGC3 ?
2014-09-21T20:12:45  <ahmed_> possibly something for v3
2014-09-21T20:12:47  <ahmed_> or v3.1
2014-09-21T20:14:32  <samson_> Ok thanks - where's the DGC3 source right now - have you got the github link for the one you're working on - I'd like to take a look

2014-09-21T21:45:36  <techbytes-lenovo> i know godaddy has the option for me to initiate the transfer if i have the access code.

2014-09-21T22:40:41  <techbytes-lenovo> solarcoin launched back in january with a huge premine so no one was mining it.  Now they are dropping block reward from 100 to 1 and then going full POS... so whoever is holding millions will make bank, like the dev.  So what we are doing is not so bad.  Just don't go POS.

2014-09-22T01:52:41  <techbytes-lenovo> no one is selling
2014-09-22T01:53:36  <techbytes-lenovo> going to move the wall up a bit and see if anyone bites
2014-09-22T01:57:03  <techbytes-lenovo> i'm going to try and figure out the quatloo bot and use it on dgc.
2014-09-22T02:00:19  <RunningmanZ> I'm using my bot on Cryptsy for DGC. I might shoot the Hass guy an email to see when Bittrex support will be added
2014-09-22T02:00:36  <RunningmanZ> DGC price is holding very nicely on Cryptsy and Bittrex

2014-09-22T02:14:48  <vinje> neoscoin guys are using quatloo too.  I need to get about 1100 more qtl to use it
2014-09-22T02:15:17  <vinje> And i'm unwilling to dump my dgc into it.  Just picking it up w/ my hashlet payouts
2014-09-22T02:16:26  <techbytes-lenovo> i thought you only need 100 for basic and 500 qtl for advanced features
2014-09-22T02:16:33  <vinje> out of curiousity, how are you using it on cryptsy techbytes?
2014-09-22T02:16:46  <vinje> I tried with the 1.0 version and it told me I needed 1200 on bittrex
2014-09-22T02:17:01  <techbytes-lenovo> i've only used it on bittrex and just to trade, nothing fancy
2014-09-22T02:17:08  <vinje> 2.0?
2014-09-22T02:17:22  <techbytes-lenovo> v2.1.1.5

2014-09-22T02:17:37  <techbytes-lenovo> yeah, don't understand to do auto trades

2014-09-22T02:18:41  <vinje> I got 5min in before it asked me to have 1200 in my balaance
2014-09-22T02:19:30  <vinje> 0_o  I just realized I don't have to use it ... from home.
2014-09-22T02:25:32  <techbytes-lenovo> "auto arbitration functions are in the works and the major update will be released October 1st"
2014-09-22T02:28:53  <kenel> wtf

2014-09-22T02:29:51  <vinje> oh wtf.  "To unlock quatloo tradeer you must have at least 1000 qtl in your balance.  To unlock advaced automated features you must have a balance of 3000 QTL
2014-09-22T02:30:05  <vinje> I could buy kenel's bot for cheaper
2014-09-22T02:32:55  <vinje> heh it still opens
2014-09-22T02:33:13  <kenel> it's fucking 3-3 in the middle of the second quarter steelers vs. carolina
2014-09-22T02:33:14  <kenel> hahahah

2014-09-22T02:35:45  <techbytes-lenovo> vinje, so the arbitration function will probably be at least 5000 qtl to use
2014-09-22T02:36:19  <kenel> RunningmanZ do you have a download link for haasbot?
2014-09-22T02:36:28  <kenel> i can't find it on their site and i can't find the email i got from them when i bought this
2014-09-22T02:39:29  <vinje> yeah, maybe if ruby ever gets out of beta :)

2014-09-22T04:44:04  <kenel> i made a support request
2014-09-22T04:44:29  <RunningmanZ> bots are still a bit buggy tho at times. I wouldn't go putting huge amounts of btc on them. I have it making alot of little trades for now
2014-09-22T04:44:40  <RunningmanZ> ok np
2014-09-22T04:45:04  <RunningmanZ> so many bloody trade indicators etc. Fun experimenting tho
2014-09-22T04:45:39  <RunningmanZ> WOuld prefer if it had mintpal and/or bittrex support tho. Cryptsy is a pain at times

2014-09-22T20:20:41  <samson_> hwy
2014-09-22T20:21:34  <samson_> what's the situation with this user, I got disconnected for some reason
2014-09-22T20:22:16  <samson_> nathalie20
2014-09-22T20:22:25  <samson_> I smell some bullshit from this user
2014-09-22T20:23:38  <samson_> This user came into the room saying their wallet wasn't working
2014-09-22T20:24:09  <samson_> We tried all sorts of stuff to get it working but they couldn't even change directory to run a rescan - ie they didn't know what the cd command was
2014-09-22T20:24:22  <samson_> then it turns out he/she's a miner and being mining coins
2014-09-22T20:24:28  <samson_> attempted to sell the wallet.dat file
2014-09-22T20:24:36  <samson_> Now posting to the DGC thread on bitcointalk
2014-09-22T20:34:41  <techbytes-lenovo> well, if she post the irc log, it will just shows that she is the idiot.
2014-09-22T20:35:18  <ahmed_> is it possible that its faked?
2014-09-22T20:35:32  <ahmed_> i dont remember the wallet having the UI icons that she posted
2014-09-22T20:36:42  <samson_> This person pretended to be completely tech illiterate
2014-09-22T20:36:45  <samson_> Clearly a lie
2014-09-22T20:37:07  <samson_> I uploaded a small cmd batch script which didn't work - another lie
2014-09-22T20:37:21  <samson_> couldn't change directory on the pc
2014-09-22T20:37:39  <samson_> ried to sell the wallet.dat file so someone else could retrieve the 'missing' coins
2014-09-22T20:37:42  <samson_> *tried
2014-09-22T20:37:54  <ahmed_>  surprise surprise
2014-09-22T20:38:02  <ahmed_> that wallet address shows 0 coins on blockr.io
2014-09-22T20:38:07  <ahmed_> (the one in the screenshot)
2014-09-22T20:38:08  <samson_> As soon as he/she said he'd been mining coins I figured we have a bullshitter here
2014-09-22T20:38:24  <samson_> Could anyoe ever mine alts without knowing how to change directory at a command prompt
2014-09-22T20:38:54  <samson_> They said the couns were there 6 or 7 months ago, when we checked the address - nothing - ever
2014-09-22T20:39:11  <ahmed_> (well 5 coins)
2014-09-22T20:39:29  <samson_> I think someone sent them today
2014-09-22T20:39:31  <ahmed_> and those 5 coins are majorly recent
2014-09-22T20:39:34  <samson_> Beore there was nothing at all
2014-09-22T20:39:36  <ahmed_> 87 confirms
2014-09-22T20:39:43  <samson_> Yes, someone in the room at the time sent them
2014-09-22T20:39:48  <ahmed_> @math 87 * 40
2014-09-22T20:39:48  <CryptoExpert> ahmed_: Error: "math" is not a valid command.
2014-09-22T20:39:50  <samson_> When we first checked there was nothing on that
2014-09-22T20:40:01  <ahmed_> @calc 87 * 40 / 60
2014-09-22T20:40:06  <CryptoExpert> ahmed_: 87 * 40 / 60 = 58
2014-09-22T20:40:15  <ahmed_> samson_: ahh yeah about an hour ago
2014-09-22T20:40:19  <samson_> yes
2014-09-22T20:40:27  <ahmed_> so that screenshot's faked them
2014-09-22T20:42:47  <ahmed_> posted on the bct threas
2014-09-22T20:42:58  <ahmed_> asking them to email me their wallet.dat
2014-09-22T20:43:34  <samson_> I was going to suggest this - tell them to send it in for analysis - there are no coins in it and we're very concerned if there is an issue
2014-09-22T20:43:35  <techbytes-lenovo> i did and she says no...
2014-09-22T20:43:58  <samson_> Because it's all bullshit that's why
2014-09-22T20:44:57  <samson_> [22/09/2014 23:24] <@samson_> Bullshit
2014-09-22T20:44:58  <samson_> [22/09/2014 23:24] <@samson_> I don't believe you at this stage
2014-09-22T20:44:58  <samson_> [22/09/2014 23:24] <nathalie20> wallet mintcoin running after half a year there is no such thing
2014-09-22T20:44:58  <samson_> [22/09/2014 23:25] <@samson_> That cmd file does the trick
2014-09-22T20:44:58  <samson_> [22/09/2014 23:25] <techbytes-lenovo> then email me the wallet.dat and password and i'll send you the dgc after recovering it.
2014-09-22T20:44:58  <samson_> [22/09/2014 23:25] <nathalie20> lenovo no
2014-09-22T20:44:58  <samson_> [22/09/2014 23:26] <@samson_> So yo uwant someone here to send you some money ?
2014-09-22T20:44:59  <samson_> [22/09/2014 23:26] <techbytes-lenovo> then good luck getting it any other ways...

2014-09-23T04:12:17  <cosmo> lol i did on accident.. they integrated the keyboard, so sometimes when you go to type a message you activate fifty things at once
2014-09-23T04:12:24  <cosmo> one of these keys logs you out
2014-09-23T04:13:06  <cosmo> how gloriously can you bastardize an online game coded entirely in java..
2014-09-23T04:14:06  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-23T04:14:07  <xawksow> hahaha

2014-09-23T04:19:58  <kenel> everyone keeps talking about that one game where you start out basically homeless
2014-09-23T04:20:01  <kenel> starts with an r i think
2014-09-23T04:20:08  <xawksow> rust
2014-09-23T04:20:13  <kenel> yeah
2014-09-23T04:20:25  <xawksow> cosmo, not really an arena, you got a quite big map where you play
2014-09-23T04:20:38  <xawksow> more like warcraft 3 maps

2014-09-23T04:36:07  <xawksow> it is a freelancer job
2014-09-23T04:36:36  <xawksow> and i failed @ calculating my hours pretty hard :D

2014-09-23T04:46:28  <Rawdawg-> hah kenel
2014-09-23T04:46:37  <Rawdawg-> that was a running joke when i was younger
2014-09-23T04:47:10  <Rawdawg-> "andrew would join the army, get to the front lines and ask, "so do i respawn here or run back from the barracks?""
2014-09-23T04:47:31  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-23T04:47:33  <Rawdawg-> heres what happened basicly
2014-09-23T04:47:52  <Rawdawg-> tooth busted (big ass molar, broke in half on some skittles)
2014-09-23T04:48:00  <Rawdawg-> then i started taking meds
2014-09-23T04:48:04  <Rawdawg-> and more meds
2014-09-23T04:48:06  <Rawdawg-> then more meds

2014-09-23T04:49:24  <cosmo> what pills were you taking?

2014-09-23T04:50:09  <Rawdawg-> (not sure if thats how you spell that)
2014-09-23T04:50:17  <Rawdawg-> and basicly washing it down with cheap scotch

2014-09-23T04:58:04  <Rawdawg-> whenever i lay down my head feels like its gonna explode
2014-09-23T04:58:23  <cosmo> Rawdawg-, a good test i know is to set an alarm and wait for it to ring
2014-09-23T04:58:35  <cosmo> simpler the better really
2014-09-23T04:58:53  <Rawdawg-> what do you mean cos?
2014-09-23T04:59:00  <Rawdawg-> just sit in silence waiting for it?
2014-09-23T04:59:04  <cosmo> to practice meditation
2014-09-23T04:59:06  <Rawdawg-> or can i have music going?
2014-09-23T04:59:09  <cosmo> lol yep
2014-09-23T04:59:17  <cosmo> silence is better
2014-09-23T04:59:27  <cosmo> there's really no such thing as silence
2014-09-23T04:59:32  <Rawdawg-> yea
2014-09-23T04:59:36  <Rawdawg-> its an illusion
2014-09-23T04:59:50  <Rawdawg-> sound is just waves of air moving toward or away from us
2014-09-23T04:59:51  <cosmo> you're an illusion, it is very real
2014-09-23T05:00:00  <Rawdawg-> as long as there is air
2014-09-23T05:00:03  <Rawdawg-> tere is sound
2014-09-23T05:00:11  <cosmo> yeah
2014-09-23T05:00:27  <cosmo> god ain't so great, can't make life on mars what a weak bitch
2014-09-23T05:00:33  <Rawdawg-> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlWuXUk-sNo
2014-09-23T05:00:37  <Rawdawg-> haha
2014-09-23T05:00:41  <Rawdawg-> think about it
2014-09-23T05:01:09  <Rawdawg-> took the earth 15 million years to for an omeba from nothing
2014-09-23T05:01:22  <Rawdawg-> then another 8 million years to make it to homo sapien
2014-09-23T05:01:36  <Rawdawg-> then 8,000 years for us to fuck it all up
2014-09-23T05:01:38  <Rawdawg-> hahahha
2014-09-23T05:01:55  <cosmo> yeah
2014-09-23T05:02:05  <cosmo> this is why i've got a personal vendetta against happiness
2014-09-23T05:02:24  <Rawdawg-> i got in an argument with one of the nurses tonight
2014-09-23T05:02:31  <Rawdawg-> when i was checking myself out
2014-09-23T05:02:45  <Rawdawg-> she was all happy about the liberals winning the majority in NB
2014-09-23T05:02:56  <cosmo> nb?
2014-09-23T05:03:08  <Rawdawg-> new brunswick sorry
2014-09-23T05:03:11  <Rawdawg-> my province
2014-09-23T05:03:23  <cosmo> ah, was thinking nova scotia
2014-09-23T05:03:31  <Rawdawg-> anyways i just said "you realize that none of this shit matters right?"
2014-09-23T05:03:52  <Rawdawg-> "what do you mean?! *defensive*"
2014-09-23T05:04:14  <cosmo> yup
2014-09-23T05:04:17  <Rawdawg-> i explained to her that her party winning means absolutely nothing in the long run
2014-09-23T05:04:25  <Rawdawg-> her vote, her opinions
2014-09-23T05:04:29  <Rawdawg-> all of it is a croc of shit
2014-09-23T05:04:35  <Rawdawg-> noone will hear it or care about it
2014-09-23T05:04:37  <cosmo> government is the biggest gang
2014-09-23T05:04:40  <Rawdawg-> if you want shit done
2014-09-23T05:04:44  <Rawdawg-> do it your fucking self
2014-09-23T05:05:04  <cosmo> apparently after buddha found enlightenment he spent years reflecting whether or not it'd make a difference preaching about it
2014-09-23T05:05:04  <Rawdawg-> become a poloticiabn
2014-09-23T05:05:17  <Rawdawg-> it wouldnt have made a dent
2014-09-23T05:05:26  <Rawdawg-> religion in general have killed our growth
2014-09-23T05:05:40  <cosmo> nah, it did in a way
2014-09-23T05:05:46  <Rawdawg-> if we didnt have christianity, right now we would probably be imortal
2014-09-23T05:05:52  <cosmo> gives people at least a better base to obsess over than christianity
2014-09-23T05:05:57  <Rawdawg-> through scientific discovery
2014-09-23T05:06:01  <Rawdawg-> the dark ages
2014-09-23T05:06:09  <cosmo> the deathless state
2014-09-23T05:06:09  <Rawdawg-> with the "christian holy crusades"
2014-09-23T05:06:20  <cosmo> ya can't stop death
2014-09-23T05:06:33  <Rawdawg-> they went throughout europe and murdered everyone that had anything to do with science
2014-09-23T05:06:47  <Rawdawg-> imagine if all those minds had of been present at the same time
2014-09-23T05:07:10  <kenel> uhm
2014-09-23T05:07:14  <cosmo> i think galileo or some dead genius thought rocks has some kind of mystical energy
2014-09-23T05:07:14  <Rawdawg-> imagine having the renisance at the same time the iphone 5 - 6 or whatever number they are on
2014-09-23T05:07:28  <kenel> are you guys both serious right now because this is hillarious
2014-09-23T05:07:32  <Rawdawg-> well they werent all right lol
2014-09-23T05:07:33  <cosmo> the iphone is not an advancement of society
2014-09-23T05:07:39  <Rawdawg-> its not
2014-09-23T05:07:46  <Rawdawg-> but its what the masses will look toward
2014-09-23T05:07:49  <Rawdawg-> not whats new
2014-09-23T05:07:56  <Rawdawg-> but whats flashy and everyone else has
2014-09-23T05:07:59  <Rawdawg-> its greed
2014-09-23T05:08:03  <Rawdawg-> its in our nature
2014-09-23T05:08:16  <cosmo> and god loves you you stupid fuck
2014-09-23T05:08:30  <Rawdawg-> i dont think god is what the bible says he is

2014-09-23T05:12:51  <Rawdawg-> best thing you can ever do is never ever ever get a CC

2014-09-23T05:14:02  <Rawdawg-> use the things you do as an outlet
2014-09-23T05:14:13  <Rawdawg-> playing a game? become the character
2014-09-23T05:14:27  <Rawdawg-> watching a movie? imagine that was you, what would you do in his situation?
2014-09-23T05:14:48  <cosmo> not to say i'm absolutely void of optimism but i'd rather stay grounded in reality
2014-09-23T05:14:58  <Rawdawg-> fuck reality
2014-09-23T05:14:59  <cosmo> which is bleak, and mundane.
2014-09-23T05:15:01  <Rawdawg-> reality sucks ass
2014-09-23T05:15:09  <cosmo> you say that but watch yourself grow old and die
2014-09-23T05:15:16  <Rawdawg-> i wont die old

2014-09-23T05:17:55  <Rawdawg-> america is collapsing right now, no production, no oil left, terribad gov

2014-09-23T05:18:30  <Rawdawg-> i think this pump is the big guys getting out
2014-09-23T05:18:57  <Rawdawg-> in our lifetime we WILL see the stock market and the US dollar collapse
2014-09-23T05:19:10  <Rawdawg-> the world as we know it will never be the same
2014-09-23T05:19:19  <cosmo> ni hau
2014-09-23T05:19:27  <Rawdawg-> ni hau
2014-09-23T05:19:59  <cosmo> a guy posted this in the dgc forums https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joITmEr4SjY
2014-09-23T05:20:02  <Rawdawg-> oh shit
2014-09-23T05:20:04  <Rawdawg-> this could be good
2014-09-23T05:20:08  <Rawdawg-> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kN1jC204rW4
2014-09-23T05:20:11  <cosmo> saying how the current government is a repeat of the roman collapse
2014-09-23T05:20:20  <Rawdawg-> yea ive seen that vid
2014-09-23T05:20:25  <Rawdawg-> that was going to be my talk in NYC
2014-09-23T05:20:27  <Rawdawg-> fuck me
2014-09-23T05:20:58  <cosmo> lol don't worry about it
2014-09-23T05:21:17  <cosmo> at the monk at the zendo i visited, he offered to let me stay, and i just started babbling in his face then he asked me to leave
2014-09-23T05:21:25  <Rawdawg-> i can send you the note sheets and everything man
2014-09-23T05:22:13  <Rawdawg-> wait
2014-09-23T05:22:26  <Rawdawg-> what were you "babbling" to him?
2014-09-23T05:22:56  <cosmo> all of my idiocy
2014-09-23T05:23:15  <Rawdawg-> you need to bottle up your hatred
2014-09-23T05:23:19  <cosmo> it's hard to deal with yourself, so when you meet someone who can, you kinda lose it
2014-09-23T05:23:25  <Rawdawg-> and only use it on the people that deserve it
2014-09-23T05:23:27  <Rawdawg-> for example
2014-09-23T05:23:49  <cosmo> i can't do that though, nobody really deserves it
2014-09-23T05:23:52  <Rawdawg-> i had a collection agency coming after me for 23.25$
2014-09-23T05:23:57  <Rawdawg-> still coming after me
2014-09-23T05:24:02  <Rawdawg-> i refuse to pay it
2014-09-23T05:24:07  <Rawdawg-> fucking douchebags
2014-09-23T05:24:11  <Rawdawg-> when they call me
2014-09-23T05:24:20  <Rawdawg-> i berate them and tell them to die in a fire
2014-09-23T05:24:22  <Rawdawg-> shit like that
2014-09-23T05:24:33  * cosmo shrugs
2014-09-23T05:24:39  <cosmo> what's the 23$ over
2014-09-23T05:24:51  <Rawdawg-> tell them that their mothers cunt smells like shit cause when i fucked her in the ass i broke the wall between puss and colon LOL
2014-09-23T05:25:02  <Rawdawg-> it was a "disconnect fee"
2014-09-23T05:25:07  <Rawdawg-> which is total shit
2014-09-23T05:25:12  <Rawdawg-> i paid off the bill in full
2014-09-23T05:25:19  <Rawdawg-> then disconnected the service
2014-09-23T05:25:25  <Rawdawg-> then ignored it forever
2014-09-23T05:25:34  <cosmo> lol how long ago did it incur
2014-09-23T05:25:45  <Rawdawg-> when they called i assumed they wanted to try and get my business back
2014-09-23T05:25:47  <Rawdawg-> THEN
2014-09-23T05:25:57  <Rawdawg-> they started leaving really nasty msgs on my maching
2014-09-23T05:26:00  <Rawdawg-> machine*
2014-09-23T05:26:33  <Rawdawg-> so then i went a little overboard
2014-09-23T05:26:42  <Rawdawg-> i called them and asked them wtf they wanted
2014-09-23T05:26:47  <Rawdawg-> and they were ignorant to me
2014-09-23T05:26:51  <Rawdawg-> over 23$
2014-09-23T05:27:01  <Rawdawg-> 2 fucking 3 $
2014-09-23T05:27:15  <cosmo> did you know
2014-09-23T05:27:19  <cosmo> that you can feed
2014-09-23T05:27:22  <cosmo> a starving african child
2014-09-23T05:27:33  <cosmo> for as little as a dollar a day

2014-09-23T05:27:48  <Rawdawg-> i can buy a taco
2014-09-23T05:28:11  <Rawdawg-> and be way happier than i would be if i gave it to a company that takes 98 cents out of it as a "management fee"
2014-09-23T05:28:22  <cosmo> you could buy at least 11 tacos
2014-09-23T05:28:32  <Rawdawg-> oh
2014-09-23T05:28:36  <cosmo> and yeah, they do that
2014-09-23T05:28:40  <Rawdawg-> i could buy 11 cheesy fries

2014-09-23T05:56:00  <Rawdawg-> im reading
2014-09-23T05:56:08  <Rawdawg-> jim careys biography
2014-09-23T05:56:17  <Rawdawg-> 12 pages then im done the book
2014-09-23T05:56:28  <Rawdawg-> then im moving on to Bill Clintons biography
2014-09-23T05:57:23  <xawksow> you like biographies?
2014-09-23T05:57:45  <Rawdawg-> love them
2014-09-23T05:57:53  <cosmo> i tried reading tim sykes
2014-09-23T05:57:59  <cosmo> lotta masturbation
2014-09-23T05:58:07  <xawksow> lol
2014-09-23T05:58:19  <Rawdawg-> yea dont read stock traders bios
2014-09-23T05:58:32  <Rawdawg-> it takes a seriously sick and fucked up person to do what we do
2014-09-23T05:58:55  <cosmo> yeah
2014-09-23T05:59:04  <cosmo> not really imo
2014-09-23T05:59:21  <cosmo> someones coordinating those price swings, you're like a robin hood out for himself
2014-09-23T05:59:48  <cosmo> i figure they just have a ring of accounts they load with money and trade between each other
2014-09-23T06:00:10  <Rawdawg-> if we are trying to fake out volume
2014-09-23T06:00:13  <Rawdawg-> yea thats the trick
2014-09-23T06:00:22  <Rawdawg-> but if you are trying to "pump" a penny stock
2014-09-23T06:00:29  <Rawdawg-> you need to send out GOOD emails
2014-09-23T06:00:41  <Rawdawg-> you need a list of 100k emails to do anything special
2014-09-23T06:01:00  <cosmo> ah yeah, have you used spam to trade?
2014-09-23T06:01:15  <cosmo> analyzed it
2014-09-23T06:01:32  <Rawdawg-> yea
2014-09-23T06:01:38  <Rawdawg-> its effective if you do the email right
2014-09-23T06:01:45  <Rawdawg-> its all about making your email stand out
2014-09-23T06:01:59  <cosmo> i watched some MIT guys do a presentation about that
2014-09-23T06:02:11  <cosmo> eventually each email became a single picture to avoid word filters
2014-09-23T06:02:29  <cosmo> i guess Reddcoin is the best example in crypto, maybe those other ones like stellar or bitshares
2014-09-23T06:04:13  <Rawdawg-> yea embedded pics work awesome
2014-09-23T06:04:19  <Rawdawg-> but you gotta make a new one every time
2014-09-23T06:04:22  <Rawdawg-> however
2014-09-23T06:04:31  <Rawdawg-> you can make 2 - 5 million from one pump
2014-09-23T06:04:51  <cosmo> god i'd never want to have to explain that to collections
2014-09-23T06:04:58  <Rawdawg-> hahahahaha
2014-09-23T06:05:24  <cosmo> i guess if it's legit they can't do anything but man
2014-09-23T06:05:25  <Rawdawg-> i gotta try and sleep now man
2014-09-23T06:05:31  <Rawdawg-> im dying in this chair lol

2014-09-23T14:01:43  <RunningmanZ> evening all
2014-09-23T14:03:03  <RunningmanZ> geez this resort is nice :D Down the beach this afternoon, then back for some fish and chips followed by a swim in the pool and some spa and sauna. Tough gig! :P
2014-09-23T14:04:51  <RunningmanZ> wireless internet  signal strength is crap in this cabin tho so using laptop via tethered mobile phone :D
2014-09-23T14:05:50  <samson_> you on holiday then ?
2014-09-23T14:07:46  <techbytes-lenovo> hey RZ, the week is going to fly by quick so enjoy it...
2014-09-23T14:07:52  <ahmed_> and as expected that natalie or whever gave a crap reply
2014-09-23T14:08:00  <samson_> yes
2014-09-23T14:08:06  <samson_> This will go nowhere
2014-09-23T14:08:34  <samson_> I suggested she either learn how to use a computer or seek your help
2014-09-23T14:09:26  <RunningmanZ> yeah at a resort down the coast for 5 nights. Its great. Has everything. Very relaxing :D
2014-09-23T14:10:05  <RunningmanZ> oh is that the chick who claims she cant see her coins in her DGC wallet?
2014-09-23T14:12:20  <ahmed_> yep
2014-09-23T14:12:34  <ahmed_> im just going to use a python wallet.dat dump tool if she's telling the truth
2014-09-23T14:12:48  <ahmed_> that way i can just import the priv keys into a V2 wallet and tell if she's lying
2014-09-23T14:13:37  <samson_> I would say there's almost zero chance that she will send that wallet to you
2014-09-23T14:14:43  <RunningmanZ> yeah i thought deleting everything except the wallet.dat and then reinstalling the client and redownloading the blockchian would have fixed it
2014-09-23T14:17:06  <samson_> At first glance there appear to be unconfirmed transactions from a pool which was mining on a fork - I'm not sure if that is the case though. so either she faked it or something else went wrong. The last hard fork on would have been late last year wouldn't it ?
2014-09-23T14:17:40  <samson_> There was a post on our forum from someone who was mining on a pool which had not upgraded at one point
2014-09-23T14:17:47  <techbytes-lenovo> if she was mining on a pool that didn't do the mandatory update, then coins she mined is invalid.  How else was she able to mine almost 3000 dgc in a week but only about a handful prior to that.
2014-09-23T14:18:17  <samson_> Yes, good point - the difficulty would go down on the fork as nobody else was mining it
2014-09-23T14:26:23  <RunningmanZ> yeah sounds more like something she did wrong rather than a wallet issue.

2014-09-23T14:43:17  <xawksow> so crisp
2014-09-23T14:43:32  <RunningmanZ> yeah another huge step up again
2014-09-23T14:43:39  <RunningmanZ> 360 degree tracking as well
2014-09-23T14:44:03  <samson_> hmm, I just ordered a rift a few weeks ago
2014-09-23T14:44:14  <RunningmanZ> not being released to devs tho. Just showing where they are
2014-09-23T14:44:15  <samson_> I've heard nothing back from them yet
2014-09-23T14:44:20  <samson_> Ah ok
2014-09-23T14:44:43  <samson_> So the finished product could be something like this
2014-09-23T14:44:53  <RunningmanZ> yeah better still do get dk2 as you won't bet able to get anything till mid ne4xt year at the earliest anyway
2014-09-23T14:45:17  <samson_> yes, just waiting for delivery now
2014-09-23T14:45:18  <RunningmanZ> samson_:the finished product will be insane even dcompared to dk2
2014-09-23T14:45:41  <RunningmanZ> they are saying that crescent bay version is like going from dk1 to dk2
2014-09-23T14:46:09  <RunningmanZ> that much of a leap again and we still have nearly a year to go before consumer release
2014-09-23T14:46:19  <samson_> so another major upgrade
2014-09-23T14:46:28  <samson_> yes, will be cool
2014-09-23T14:46:29  <RunningmanZ> VR is the next kilelr technology guranteed'
2014-09-23T14:46:36  <samson_> VR will be massive
2014-09-23T14:46:41  <RunningmanZ> yep
2014-09-23T14:47:11  <samson_> I'd like to hook it up to a drone and fly it like a real aircraft
2014-09-23T14:47:15  <RunningmanZ> i read some reviews of cresent bay and the immersion is even more nuts
2014-09-23T14:47:34  <RunningmanZ> yeah i think u can already do it eith an app lol
2014-09-23T14:47:48  <RunningmanZ> im sure i read about someone playing around with that
2014-09-23T14:47:52  <RunningmanZ> for dk1
2014-09-23T14:47:57  <samson_> I'm sure - one of them little quadracopters or something - would be good
2014-09-23T14:48:51  <samson_> I could fly it down to the local bar to see who's in there before deciding whether to go out or not
2014-09-23T14:48:52  <RunningmanZ> possibilities are endless. seeing is believeing so with VR you WILL think you are wherever the app/game takjes you
2014-09-23T14:48:59  <samson_> lol
2014-09-23T14:49:20  <RunningmanZ> its crazy immersion factor lol
2014-09-23T14:49:57  <RunningmanZ> i think my dk2 should ship any day now
2014-09-23T14:50:23  <RunningmanZ> they are starting june shipping for australia this week and teh US is already late July

2014-09-23T14:52:33  <RunningmanZ> i haven't tried since i was trading on Bittrex yesterday. Hd to turn off my bot while im on holiday
2014-09-23T14:52:43  <kenel-work> well this one doesn't even have bittrex
2014-09-23T14:53:31  <RunningmanZ> i ad to turn it on in the api settings
2014-09-23T14:53:50  <RunningmanZ> was your downlkoad an exe file?
2014-09-23T14:54:42  <RunningmanZ> mine installed fien after i told windows to stop blocking it lol

2014-09-23T14:55:04  <CoHe> hey Kenel
2014-09-23T14:55:11  <kenel-work> hi cohe
2014-09-23T14:55:34  <RunningmanZ> or that might have been my av because it was an exe file. It was clean tho when i scanned it. I would contact Stephan again and get him to help you.
2014-09-23T14:56:52  <CoHe> DGC seems to be booming here on the IRC.Much more activity as one would expect going by the forum alone.Is nice to see
2014-09-23T14:56:57  <RunningmanZ> all i did was use the link in my email. then run the setup and put in my email address and serial number which is listed when you login to the site. Then i had to setup my API settings again
2014-09-23T14:57:13  <RunningmanZ> CoHe:yep its great to see
2014-09-23T14:57:44  <kenel-work> dgc has almost always been a mainly IRC community, working to stop that
2014-09-23T14:58:25  <kenel-work> RunningmanZ what i get is some server that loads up on port 8090
2014-09-23T14:58:28  <kenel-work> wtf
2014-09-23T14:59:45  <RunningmanZ> it runs on your own machine its for the trade bot
2014-09-23T15:00:28  <RunningmanZ> but does tghe software install and startup for you. It should put an icon in your system tray after u start it. takes a min or tow tho
2014-09-23T15:01:07  <RunningmanZ> fk this creeps me out. prequel to 'The Conjuring'. Fk that doll its fkin CREEPY!! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdUysoK6tdQ

2014-09-23T23:28:31  <samson_> That new thread should really have [ANN] [DGC] in it's title - I'm not sure if that can be changed

2014-09-24T00:08:12  <xawksow> we will import the posts
2014-09-24T00:08:21  <xawksow> got a tool for that
2014-09-24T00:08:27  <baritus> in that case you can ask me for newest db when you're up
2014-09-24T00:08:45  <baritus> those tools often screw up, be careful ;)
2014-09-24T00:09:04  <xawksow> i know, but there can't go much wrong on a clean vb install.
2014-09-24T00:09:15  <baritus> the import can however
2014-09-24T00:09:21  <baritus> especially with user profiles
2014-09-24T00:09:33  <xawksow> yea sure, but nothing i can't fix

2014-09-24T02:42:05  <xawksow> mmh
2014-09-24T02:42:13  <xawksow> need to speak to cohe again before i can start +.~
2014-09-24T02:45:47  <xawksow> sooo
2014-09-24T02:45:51  <xawksow> i just found a lottery script
2014-09-24T02:45:55  <xawksow> which i could easily port to dgc
2014-09-24T02:46:04  <xawksow> anyone want to have a dgc lottery? :D
2014-09-24T02:46:43  <samson_> There was one before
2014-09-24T02:48:24  <xawksow> and where is it now?
2014-09-24T02:48:26  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-24T02:48:43  <samson_> No idea, it was a long time ago
2014-09-24T02:48:52  <xawksow> ok
2014-09-24T02:51:35  <techbytes> that was mob site i think, the lottery.  He had a bunch of coins on there.
2014-09-24T02:54:01  <xawksow> can we get that up again or at least the source?
2014-09-24T02:55:49  <techbytes> maybe... and have 5% go to the foundation.
2014-09-24T02:56:26  <xawksow> or maybe 10%
2014-09-24T02:56:27  <xawksow> <3
2014-09-24T02:56:38  <xawksow> update the lottery pot once a day
2014-09-24T02:56:54  <xawksow> no one will know how much exactly is in there and how much we will get
2014-09-24T02:57:01  <xawksow> :>
2014-09-24T02:57:37  <techbytes> i think you should show the pot size..
2014-09-24T02:58:33  <techbytes> and should be realtime no?
2014-09-24T02:58:39  <xawksow> well, it is shown. but its value isn't accurate
2014-09-24T02:58:51  <xawksow> i would not make it realtime
2014-09-24T02:59:41  <xawksow> so would you try to get the source?
2014-09-24T03:00:12  <techbytes> source for?
2014-09-24T03:00:33  <techbytes> to run the lottery?
2014-09-24T03:01:28  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-24T03:01:34  <xawksow> mobs lottery source
2014-09-24T03:02:25  <xawksow> we've massive capacity to host shitloads of dgc services, so why not start with a lottery :D
2014-09-24T03:04:39  <techbytes> running lottery site isn't consider money laundering?  Don't want to deal with that if it is.
2014-09-24T03:05:01  <techbytes> or what's the term
2014-09-24T03:05:19  <xawksow> we can host it in russia
2014-09-24T03:05:25  <xawksow> we got a good hoster over there
2014-09-24T03:05:39  <xawksow> don't know if it is money laundering
2014-09-24T03:06:27  <techbytes> that's no difference from cryptowheel where you spin for dgc...
2014-09-24T03:06:49  <xawksow> yea probably not
2014-09-24T03:08:49  <xawksow> would be cool to have the lottery directly in the wallet tho
2014-09-24T03:08:57  <xawksow> so no website to play on
2014-09-24T03:09:04  <xawksow> only the wallet <-> website api
2014-09-24T03:09:50  <xawksow> then get the "dgclottery.to" domain and a server in russia. profit. :D
2014-09-24T03:11:10  <xawksow> ok got a better idea
2014-09-24T03:11:14  <xawksow> will figure somethin out

2014-09-24T04:05:14  <vinje> lottery in the US doesn't follow the same rules as poker/gambling sites.  Not sure of the rule but you'd want to search for raffle.  Schools and business do it all the time.
2014-09-24T04:05:36  <vinje> and dgc isn't technically money
2014-09-24T04:06:43  <kenel> fucking wtf
2014-09-24T04:06:47  <kenel> everyone says they paid
2014-09-24T04:06:54  <kenel> i hate this shit ;(
2014-09-24T04:12:48  <vinje> it will be the one that didn't inclue tx fee cause he's a cheap bastard
2014-09-24T04:13:00  <techbytes> get everyone to post tx id... i know mob didn't pay yet

2014-09-24T04:15:23  <xawksow> or we will leave it as it is
2014-09-24T04:15:28  <xawksow> and end up with some lost posts if any
2014-09-24T04:15:50  <samson_> Is there a setting to make it read only ?
2014-09-24T04:16:39  <xawksow> i dont think so
2014-09-24T04:16:47  <xawksow> if i set to maintenance normal users can't access the forum
2014-09-24T04:17:54  <techbytes> put it in maintenance mode and start the transfer.  kenel?
2014-09-24T04:18:08  <samson_> if it's just for a short amount of time it doesn't matter
2014-09-24T04:21:05  <xawksow> well i'll start it now

2014-09-24T04:39:09  <samson_> Did the forum run behind cloudflare or something smiilar before ?
2014-09-24T04:40:41  <samson_> looks like it didn't, I have www.digitalcoin.co cached locally on 50.63.202.26

2014-09-24T05:01:41  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-24T05:01:42  <kenel> using like 400mb RAM, etc.
2014-09-24T05:01:42  <xawksow> can be true
2014-09-24T05:04:31  <kenel> i don't mean the one you're working on xawksow i mean the current 2.0

2014-09-24T05:07:07  <xawksow> well then you need to wait a bit more or type "ipconfig /flushdns" and try it again a few times
2014-09-24T05:07:37  <xawksow> well you are right, it seems like it is switching the ips
2014-09-24T05:07:37  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-24T05:07:47  <xawksow> sometimes the old, sometimes the new
2014-09-24T05:08:08  <xawksow> can take a few hours to work properly
2014-09-24T05:12:59  <kenel> yeah, depends on the dns you use i guess
2014-09-24T05:13:07  <kenel> i think i'm using....level3 or google

2014-09-24T15:05:21  <xawksow> perfect
2014-09-24T15:08:40  <xawksow> Good morning,
2014-09-24T15:08:40  <xawksow> I've moved the forum last night to one of our foundation servers.
2014-09-24T15:08:40  <xawksow> We got now access to the domains and will proceed in transfering the argentum and securecoin websites too.
2014-09-24T15:08:40  <xawksow> Besides that, we will prepare everything for moving to vBulletin and away from SMF.
2014-09-24T15:08:42  <xawksow> xawksow
2014-09-24T15:08:50  <xawksow> like that?

2014-09-24T15:08:51  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-24T15:09:30  <samson_> Might I suggest a couple of changes ?
2014-09-24T15:10:30  <xawksow> sure
2014-09-24T15:10:30  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-24T15:10:45  <samson_> Good Morning,
2014-09-24T15:12:16  <samson_> We (DGC Foundation) now have full control over the digialcoin.co and related domains, these domains including this forum are now hosted on one of the DGC Foundation servers.
2014-09-24T15:13:37  <samson_> The Argentum and Securecoin websites will also be moved over to the DGC Foundation server now we have control of the domains.
2014-09-24T15:14:54  <samson_> In addition to this we will be migrating the forum over to the vBulletin system and away from the SMF system which we've been using so far.
2014-09-24T15:15:12  <xawksow> thank you :>
2014-09-24T15:15:28  <samson_> No problems, just a suggestion

2014-09-24T23:20:48  <xawksow> it seems that vbulletin can't read the smf passwords, so we need every user to reset his password
2014-09-24T23:25:40  <xawksow> + the ????? are still there
2014-09-24T23:25:41  <xawksow> XD

2014-09-24T23:25:59  <xawksow> but i think there were not that much posts either
2014-09-24T23:31:27  <samson_> Different forums use different hashes to store passwords I believe
2014-09-24T23:31:47  <samson_> If there any way to modify the algorithm so it matches up ?
2014-09-24T23:32:21  <samson_> I suspect this might be able to be done but I have no idea how...

2014-09-25T00:06:22  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-25T00:06:23  <xawksow> that is the plan
2014-09-25T00:10:31  <xawksow> we should probably send an email out anyway and inform everyone about v3
2014-09-25T00:10:37  <xawksow> + forum switch
2014-09-25T00:10:49  <samson_> Yes, sounds like a good idea
2014-09-25T00:10:52  <xawksow> and that they need to use the "forgot password" function to reset it
2014-09-25T00:10:56  <xawksow> :]
2014-09-25T00:11:56  <samson_> Yes, a link to the 'forget password' in the email would be ideal
2014-09-25T00:13:17  <xawksow> yea sure :D
2014-09-25T00:16:10  <xawksow> currently fixing the user groups
2014-09-25T00:17:02  <xawksow> we need to decide if we change some moderators or else
2014-09-25T00:17:09  <xawksow> because the list is big
2014-09-25T00:17:16  <xawksow> and i think we can cut them
2014-09-25T00:18:31  <samson_> This would need further discussion i think - people get pissed off when things are taken away from them - even if it's small things like this
2014-09-25T00:19:01  <xawksow> yea, but the usergroups are totally messed up after the import. everyone got 0 permissions
2014-09-25T00:19:08  <samson_> However, foundation control would seem to suggest foundation mods, etc
2014-09-25T00:19:09  <xawksow> and now i need to reorder everything
2014-09-25T00:19:11  <samson_> I see
2014-09-25T00:19:15  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-25T00:19:17  <xawksow> exactly
2014-09-25T00:19:31  <xawksow> + who is administrator
2014-09-25T00:19:43  <xawksow> because i think we will take that from baritus
2014-09-25T00:19:49  <xawksow> and give him something else to do
2014-09-25T00:19:49  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-25T00:21:12  <samson_> I am an admin on the existing system

2014-09-25T02:36:07  <xawksow> that is strange
2014-09-25T02:37:08  <kenel> my guess is it checks it for .com .net .co .whatever
2014-09-25T02:37:13  <kenel> probably has a list somewhere
2014-09-25T02:37:56  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-25T02:37:58  <xawksow> i think so too
2014-09-25T02:38:02  <xawksow> i just need to find out where
2014-09-25T02:49:43  <kenel> well i can't find it in the options
2014-09-25T02:49:47  <kenel> it must be hard coded?
2014-09-25T02:53:34  <xawksow> i can'T find it in the databse either
2014-09-25T02:53:49  <xawksow> so yea, i think somewhere is a file or line of code which prevents that

2014-09-25T14:34:13  <kenel-work> TIL techbytes techbytes-lenovo (aka lenovo) likes pudding
2014-09-25T14:34:38  <kenel-work> damn, that formatting with the quoting is bad ;\
2014-09-25T14:35:04  <kenel-work> also, the light grey is kind of hard to read + default text is very very small
2014-09-25T14:36:25  <xawksow> better now with the default style?
2014-09-25T14:36:26  <xawksow> x]
2014-09-25T14:36:34  <kenel-work> oh god yes
2014-09-25T14:36:46  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-25T14:36:59  <kenel-work> but just a suggestion -- can you split the difference between the left and right columns, or get rid of one of them completely?
2014-09-25T14:37:17  <kenel-work> my eyes keep getting drawn to the exact middle of the page, but it's offset to the right for some reason
2014-09-25T14:38:04  <kenel-work> i know it's minor, but it annoys the hell out of me, lol

2014-09-26T01:45:45  <Guest65202> looks pretty
2014-09-26T01:46:00  <xawksow> not too dark?
2014-09-26T01:46:03  <Guest65202> still on digitalcoin.co? or do we run that domain now
2014-09-26T01:46:09  <xawksow> we got that domain now
2014-09-26T01:46:19  <xawksow> and everything you are seeing is on our server already
2014-09-26T01:46:20  <Guest65202> not dark at all, i like it
2014-09-26T01:46:26  <xawksow> ok, sweet
2014-09-26T01:46:26  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-26T01:46:51  <Guest65202> great layout in the news section, ugly white patch on the 'blog' part that goes against the dark theme
2014-09-26T01:46:55  <Guest65202> you probably already got that :p
2014-09-26T01:47:37  <xawksow> yea, fixed :p
2014-09-26T01:48:06  <Guest65202> the flash as an admin, i like
2014-09-26T01:48:32  <Guest65202> the community 'stream' is great too
2014-09-26T01:48:34  <techbytes-lenovo> text a bit whiter is easier to read for old folks like me... :)  also, are you going to use the same logo as on digitalcoin.co?
2014-09-26T01:48:56  <xawksow> i'm not sure
2014-09-26T01:49:11  <xawksow> currently i modded it a bit and thats our logo on vbulletin
2014-09-26T01:49:16  <techbytes-lenovo> the one you have now is not sharp
2014-09-26T01:50:03  <techbytes-lenovo> can't make out what's the text on the bottom of the logo
2014-09-26T01:51:17  <xawksow> oh ok
2014-09-26T01:51:22  <xawksow> i can read that pretty good tho
2014-09-26T01:51:32  <xawksow> i will just make the font size a bit bigger
2014-09-26T01:51:46  <xawksow> don't want to increase the height more
2014-09-26T01:51:49  <xawksow> as it is big enough
2014-09-26T01:52:34  <techbytes-lenovo> font size is fine.
2014-09-26T01:52:43  <xawksow> perfect.
2014-09-26T01:52:50  <xawksow> <3
2014-09-26T01:53:11  <techbytes-lenovo> just a bit on the dark side
2014-09-26T01:55:45  <xawksow> when i'm done with my current project, i'll write a tip extension for vbulletin. then we can tip each user when he posts something we find useful, with internal dgc wallet and stuff
2014-09-26T01:56:40  <techbytes-lenovo> nice feature
2014-09-26T01:56:47  <xawksow> yea i think so too
2014-09-26T01:56:48  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-26T02:01:17  <xawksow> the font is now a bit bigger, would you check if that is ok?
2014-09-26T02:03:29  <techbytes-lenovo> better but with font, people can adjust with their broswer setting.
2014-09-26T02:04:22  <techbytes-lenovo> can you make font color white just to see how it looks?
2014-09-26T02:10:51  <xawksow> it isn't easy to set everything to white
2014-09-26T02:10:52  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-26T02:10:54  <xawksow> however
2014-09-26T02:11:03  <xawksow> i can set the forum posts text color a bit lighter
2014-09-26T02:11:05  <xawksow> if that helps? :s

2014-09-26T02:21:22  <kenel> wow, i like that, but...
2014-09-26T02:21:25  <kenel> again with the tiny tiny fonts
2014-09-26T02:22:05  <xawksow> hold strg and scroll forward

2014-09-26T02:22:15  <xawksow> in your tiny world
2014-09-26T02:22:16  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-26T02:22:39  <kenel> yeah, but i'm telling you, people aren't going to stick around a long time and read our forum if they always have to squint
2014-09-26T02:23:50  <techbytes-lenovo> agreed and some will not know how to change the font size.
2014-09-26T02:26:45  <xawksow> font size of everything?
2014-09-26T02:26:54  <xawksow> i did change it now for the posts http://forum.digitalcoin.co/threads/1539-Server-Move-Complete-2-Domain-Transfer-to-the-Foundation?p=25888#post25888

2014-09-26T02:26:59  <kenel> honestly i think the top 10 can stay small
2014-09-26T02:27:25  <kenel> but the subform links, descriptions, etc etc need to be like 1pt bigger
2014-09-26T02:27:51  <kenel> for example, on my huge monitor...i can't read the damn links when i go to a sub forum
2014-09-26T02:29:36  <xawksow> now nearly everything is 12p
2014-09-26T02:29:37  <xawksow> +.~
2014-09-26T02:30:09  <xawksow> is dat huge enough? everything bigger will probably screw the theme up
2014-09-26T02:36:42  <kenel> something just seems off, but it's ok for now
2014-09-26T02:36:47  <kenel> i don't know what yet
2014-09-26T02:49:31  <xawksow> fixed the top stats
2014-09-26T02:49:39  <xawksow> i think we are nearly good to go.
2014-09-26T02:50:05  <xawksow> don't know what misses
2014-09-26T02:55:36  <kenel> you know what xawksow ?
2014-09-26T02:55:39  <kenel> i think i figured it out
2014-09-26T02:55:42  <kenel> it's the overly dark theme
2014-09-26T02:56:06  <kenel> yahoo gets away with a similar theme, but they have a background that draws your eyes where it should be

2014-09-26T02:56:35  <xawksow> so you want some fancy background?
2014-09-26T02:57:03  <kenel> i don't know, honestly; i'm not opposed to the darkness, but i think the background needs to be completely different to draw your eyes to the text area where they should be
2014-09-26T03:01:59  <techbytes-lenovo> their text is whiter
2014-09-26T03:09:01  <xawksow> http://forum.digitalcoin.co/forum.php how about that background

2014-09-26T03:12:08  <xawksow> ok, fuck you then, we are now a rainbow
2014-09-26T03:12:20  <kenel> lol
2014-09-26T03:12:43  <kenel> we'll figure it out man; to be completely honest i have no clue wtf i think looks best
2014-09-26T03:12:52  <kenel> we may just have to keep tweaking here and there until it's perfect?
2014-09-26T03:13:13  <xawksow> probably
2014-09-26T03:13:21  <xawksow> but we are now a rainbow. so better start shit some colors
2014-09-26T03:13:55  <xawksow> trying to find a good background pattern
2014-09-26T03:13:58  <xawksow> but it isn't that easy
2014-09-26T03:14:03  <kenel> the part that keeps being a rainbow
2014-09-26T03:14:06  <kenel> can that be transparent?
2014-09-26T03:14:15  <kenel> and the part outside the wrapper can that be the background?
2014-09-26T03:14:39  <kenel> oh
2014-09-26T03:14:46  <kenel> sorry techbytes techbytes-lenovo i should've mentioned
2014-09-26T03:14:54  <kenel> i would've bet washington second half

2014-09-26T03:21:02  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-26T03:21:19  <xawksow> but that is how you wanted it right?
2014-09-26T03:21:20  <kenel> no, i know, it was just an example
2014-09-26T03:21:29  <xawksow> transparent and shit
2014-09-26T03:21:39  <kenel> yeah, but the breadcrumbs shouldn't be transparent or the 'reply to thread' or the thread title
2014-09-26T03:21:44  <kenel> i don't know how involved that is
2014-09-26T03:23:00  <kenel> also you took the small image
2014-09-26T03:23:08  <kenel> there's a 'download' that has a huge image
2014-09-26T03:23:11  <kenel> but it was just an example
2014-09-26T03:24:26  <kenel> i don't know, maybe i'm just crazy, but even with this example...you see how it makes your eyes go exactly where they're supposed to?
2014-09-26T03:24:44  <xawksow> yeeeeeeeeeeees
2014-09-26T03:24:48  <xawksow> how about that background now
2014-09-26T03:25:17  <kenel> i like that a lot
2014-09-26T03:25:43  <kenel> white is a bit much though

2014-09-26T03:28:43  <kenel> i think the blue headlines with the blue links on the main forum page might be a bit busy
2014-09-26T03:28:56  <kenel> but what color
2014-09-26T03:28:57  <kenel> i don't know
2014-09-26T03:29:23  <kenel> can you make the subforum headlines greyish like the top10 stats?
2014-09-26T03:29:41  <kenel> also i might just be nitpicking at this point, i don't know
2014-09-26T03:30:41  <techbytes> actually, looking at it on my desktop looks fine... i guess my laptop brightness isn't bright enough.
2014-09-26T03:30:59  <xawksow> well, imo blue is better, otherwise you don't recognize it as a subforum
2014-09-26T03:31:12  <kenel> just throwing it out there, not saying i'm right
2014-09-26T03:31:25  <kenel> oh wtf redskins
2014-09-26T03:32:01  <kenel> so top 10 stats
2014-09-26T03:32:10  <kenel> can we just do latest 10 posts like what we had on the old forum?
2014-09-26T03:32:17  <kenel> don't know how big of a PITA that is
2014-09-26T03:33:49  <xawksow> well as you can see
2014-09-26T03:33:53  <xawksow> it doesn't work out good

2014-09-26T03:34:51  <techbytes> right... need to do it on the old forum

2014-09-26T03:40:36  <xawksow> okay, what now? xD
2014-09-26T03:41:25  <kenel> brighten up the child forum descriptions and thread/post count and last post? (not the links, the text) ? is that separate from the actual thread text?
2014-09-26T03:41:49  <kenel> then if that's possible...maybe darken the sticky threads so they still stand out
2014-09-26T03:41:50  <kenel> idk
2014-09-26T03:41:54  <kenel> know*
2014-09-26T03:42:05  <xawksow> yea it is seperate
2014-09-26T03:42:13  <xawksow> btw. techbytes just posted a link to the new forum

2014-09-26T03:50:34  <xawksow> better eh?
2014-09-26T03:51:50  <xawksow> the forum is showing a notice to every guest that they need to reset their passwords to login
2014-09-26T03:52:04  <xawksow> so for every randomguy who wants to login, there is already some help +.~
2014-09-26T03:55:55  <xawksow> soo
2014-09-26T03:55:56  <xawksow> what now?
2014-09-26T03:56:12  <xawksow> put the smf forum down in maintenance mode and give them a link to the new?
2014-09-26T03:57:10  <techbytes> can't we do redirect?
2014-09-26T03:57:24  <xawksow> we can
2014-09-26T03:57:33  <xawksow> but the question is, is that better?
2014-09-26T03:59:19  <techbytes> isn't that the normal way of doing it?  wouldn't hurt
2014-09-26T03:59:51  <xawksow> so you just want to redirect /forums/ to the new one
2014-09-26T04:02:01  <xawksow> so we probably should setup an announcement in the new forum
2014-09-26T04:02:05  <xawksow> that we successfully migrated
2014-09-26T04:04:47  <techbytes> yeah and on bitcointalk as well.
2014-09-26T04:06:01  <xawksow> Good evening DigitalCoin Community,
2014-09-26T04:06:01  <xawksow> We migrated successfully the old forum into this one.
2014-09-26T04:06:01  <xawksow> Every user and his posts got imported correctly.
2014-09-26T04:06:01  <xawksow> In order to login properly, you need to reset your password.
2014-09-26T04:06:02  <xawksow> By having problems with that, click on the webchat and we will help you right away!
2014-09-26T04:06:04  <xawksow> The DigitalCoin Foundation
2014-09-26T04:06:06  <xawksow> like that?

2014-09-26T04:08:59  <xawksow> that we've successfully migrated
2014-09-26T04:09:07  <xawksow> or should i change there something
2014-09-26T04:09:25  <kenel> you can, but where it says 'reset' you need to link to the 'forgot password?' page
2014-09-26T04:14:16  <xawksow> ok

2014-09-26T15:59:50  <xawksow> lolo
2014-09-26T15:59:58  <techbytes> xawksow, so all we need now is the alert keys from baritus?
2014-09-26T16:00:34  <xawksow> yea more i think so
2014-09-26T16:00:47  <xawksow> and i just realized that i got only 6 days for everything
2014-09-26T16:00:48  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-26T16:01:05  <xawksow> would be good to get them techbytes
2014-09-26T16:01:20  <xawksow> it would probably work without them, but it could be a little mess
2014-09-26T16:01:51  <techbytes> ok, i'll email him
2014-09-26T16:03:08  <xawksow> sweet :>
2014-09-26T16:07:30  <samson_> Didn't Baritus say he has lost the alert key ?
2014-09-26T16:07:45  <xawksow> didn't he say he just can't find it currently?
2014-09-26T16:07:46  <xawksow> D:
2014-09-26T16:07:56  <techbytes-lenovo> he did say that?
2014-09-26T16:08:09  <samson_> He said it to someone in an email I believe
2014-09-26T16:08:16  <xawksow> mh
2014-09-26T16:08:18  <techbytes-lenovo> i just emailed him asking for it.  We'll see what he says.
2014-09-26T16:08:22  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-26T16:08:29  <samson_> Was there an alert last time there was a hard fork ?
2014-09-26T16:08:39  <samson_> I don't thnk there was...
2014-09-26T16:08:56  <samson_> Probably for the same reason
2014-09-26T16:09:04  <xawksow> lol
2014-09-26T16:09:21  <xawksow> okay, then we will need ahmed to add some new alert keys for us
2014-09-26T16:10:18  <xawksow> btw. while i'm away, nilz got root access to the foundation server, so call him if there goes something horrible wrong
2014-09-26T16:10:28  <xawksow> otherwise tt got them too
2014-09-26T16:10:38  <techbytes> OK
2014-09-26T16:10:49  <xawksow> pool server root access got kenel and me
2014-09-26T16:11:00  <samson_> Did we get an off server backup setup ?
2014-09-26T16:11:19  <xawksow> nilz will set one up
2014-09-26T16:11:25  <samson_> cool
2014-09-26T16:11:26  <xawksow> he has experience in doing so
2014-09-26T16:11:50  <xawksow> probably will work next week monday or tuesday
2014-09-26T16:12:10  <samson_> I would setup a mysqldump running on a cron so the database dump gets backed up along with the rest of it
2014-09-26T16:12:30  <samson_> probably keep a few generations of db dumps
2014-09-26T16:13:01  <xawksow> yea sounds good, i think it will be done somehow like that
2014-09-26T16:13:07  <samson_> ok

2014-09-26T16:18:57  <samson_> I'll try again
2014-09-26T16:19:01  <xawksow> oh maybe because it is too short

2014-09-26T17:17:11  <xawksow> lol
2014-09-26T17:17:32  <xawksow> need to ask nilz how to get both domains working for our emails :p
2014-09-26T17:59:33  <ahmed_> xawksow: yeah he took it down
2014-09-26T17:59:49  <ahmed_> he doesnt do it for free anymore since it costs to host a block explorer :)
2014-09-26T17:59:57  <ahmed_> (although CCE v3.5 looks sweet)
2014-09-26T18:08:06  <CoHe> Yea Xawsjow you should give me superrrrman mod anyway!

2014-09-26T18:33:55  <techbytes> how come it has to open a new window to play the song on the forum?  closed the window and the song stop playing
2014-09-26T18:34:04  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-26T18:34:06  <xawksow> i'm not sure
2014-09-26T18:34:10  <xawksow> just noticed the same
2014-09-26T18:38:13  <xawksow> will try to figure out what it is
2014-09-26T18:39:01  <techbytes> looks like you need an account to play the song.  The new window is account verification i think
2014-09-26T18:39:57  <xawksow> yea, but it shouldn't do that either
2014-09-26T18:40:02  <xawksow> i got an account
2014-09-26T18:40:05  <xawksow> and i am logged in
2014-09-26T18:40:13  <xawksow> the song plays when i hit play and stay on the new site
2014-09-26T18:40:29  <xawksow> but i think it should play right away if logged in to spotify somewhere
2014-09-26T18:40:35  <xawksow> something is not workinig properly
2014-09-26T18:42:01  <techbytes> yeah, i'm logged in and it played in both places
2014-09-26T18:46:44  <xawksow> mh, i can't fix it, that is spotifys way to open stuff. but you can set to open it only in desktop somewhere in the settings
2014-09-26T18:47:06  <xawksow> but that seems not to work for me, so i'll go with that stupid webplayer

2014-09-26T22:04:28  <xawksow> derp!
2014-09-26T22:08:11  <cosmo> whatsup?
2014-09-26T22:08:47  <xawksow> well i posted a link, but it isnt there, do you need to moderate that
2014-09-26T22:08:52  <xawksow> or am i just too stupid for reddit
2014-09-26T22:08:52  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-26T22:09:00  <cosmo> reddit's too stupid for you
2014-09-26T22:09:22  <cosmo> idk, there shouldn't be any restrictions
2014-09-26T22:09:35  <cosmo> try posting it again, last post i see from you was 9 days ago, the 3.0 announcement
2014-09-26T22:11:05  <cosmo> we have a reddit tipbot btw :o it never gets used
2014-09-26T22:11:14  <cosmo> we should utilize that, start a tip party
2014-09-26T22:11:26  <cosmo> swarm /r/cryptocurrency
2014-09-26T22:11:39  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-26T22:11:39  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-26T22:40:40  <xawksow> its nice to see we got some new members
2014-09-26T22:40:47  <xawksow> @ main channel
2014-09-26T22:40:47  <CryptoExpert> xawksow: Error: "main" is not a valid command.
2014-09-26T22:41:43  <xawksow> or at least some members we didn't know before
2014-09-26T23:06:21  <samson_> When I viewed the forum the posts don't appear to be automatically sorted by the last post date
2014-09-26T23:07:42  <samson_> I fixed that by clicking 'Last Post By' twice so it sorted them into reverse chronological (newest first) order - I've never seen this on a forum before though : maybe it was the import process ?
2014-09-26T23:09:33  <cosmo> any luck with the op_return samson_?
2014-09-26T23:16:35  <xawksow> thats weird samson, i got no such problem
2014-09-26T23:18:48  * cosmo pokes samson_
2014-09-26T23:20:06  <cosmo> the timestamping is the only thing left to do imo, we don't have to involve it with this fork
2014-09-26T23:20:28  <cosmo> and frankly i still think merge-mining is the only way to be taken seriously, ie doge and paypal (shudders)
2014-09-26T23:20:36  <cosmo> that really pisses me off
2014-09-26T23:21:14  <cosmo> so if you need more time we can always just leave it for later
2014-09-26T23:22:14  <xawksow> 3 google crawler @ forum
2014-09-26T23:25:19  <samson_> Just allow me to add data with the op_return, plenty of bytes - it's something I will start using in time - but it needs to be in the fork
2014-09-26T23:26:12  <cosmo> how long do you think it'll take you?
2014-09-26T23:26:42  <samson_> I don't know - it doesn't matter really as long as it's enabled
2014-09-26T23:27:00  <samson_> I'm still writing basic building blocks right now - then I'll move ove to raw transactions
2014-09-26T23:27:07  <samson_> *over
2014-09-26T23:27:58  <samson_> I've took a look at the raw transactions processing and it doesn't look that complex at first glance
2014-09-26T23:28:22  <xawksow> sounds good imo
2014-09-26T23:28:25  <xawksow> we should wait for that
2014-09-26T23:28:31  <samson_> If ahmed adds a simplr RPC call which sends a transaction with an op_return into the client then it won't even require a raw transaction
2014-09-26T23:28:39  <samson_> you could fork it tomorrow
2014-09-26T23:28:48  <cosmo> you're saying if op_return is enabled in the fork, you can work in whatever through future soft-forks?
2014-09-26T23:29:18  <samson_> so long as the functionality is there in the DGCv3 I'll start using it at some point when my code is ready and probably others too
2014-09-26T23:29:50  <cosmo> cool
2014-09-26T23:30:36  <cosmo> has a method to prevent intentional bloating been decided?
2014-09-26T23:30:37  <samson_> The basic 80 byte functionality is already there - I think 1 number needs changing - the number of bytes and some kind of encoding enforcement - transaction fees should be considered as well but I don't know how that works
2014-09-26T23:30:53  <samson_> You can't prevent intentional bloating anyway
2014-09-26T23:31:42  <cosmo> only charge fees
2014-09-26T23:31:51  <samson_> There are other ways to store data in the blockchain which can take up large amounts of bytes - like big multi sig requirements - these can include a lot of data from what I've read
2014-09-26T23:32:59  <cosmo> like requiring hundreds of priv. keys to access one address, that might hold .00001 dgc or whatever? i watched a video on multisig addresses, only used 3 in the example
2014-09-26T23:33:21  <samson_> This is why Bitcoin reduced the storage to 40 bytes instead of banning it - if they banned it people would switch over to mich larger in terms of bytes storage methods rsulting in even more bloat
2014-09-26T23:33:27  <samson_> Yes exactly cosmo
2014-09-26T23:36:47  <cosmo> couldn't you just enforce a 3 multisig maximum? :\
2014-09-26T23:37:16  <samson_> I don't know
2014-09-26T23:37:25  <samson_> maybe
2014-09-26T23:37:37  <cosmo> another thing, if we do switch to multi-algo, how hard will it be updating along with BTC? it'd be best to just copy the source of the pros
2014-09-26T23:37:48  <cosmo> ahmed_
2014-09-26T23:38:08  <cosmo> from what i understand we replaced DGC with DGB, then carried over the old chain
2014-09-26T23:38:30  <cosmo> if we wanna change/add a facet of the code, how hard would that be?
2014-09-26T23:38:51  <cosmo> copy+paste it from BTC 2.0 or whatever
2014-09-26T23:39:21  <cosmo> depends on the code yeah but is it really as simple as copy+paste into DGC?
2014-09-26T23:41:30  <samson_> DGC is a copy/paste
2014-09-26T23:41:35  <samson_> the whole thing
2014-09-26T23:41:47  <samson_> with some small mods
2014-09-26T23:41:56  <samson_> that's how it works
2014-09-26T23:43:00  <samson_> take a look at the highlighted source code diffs and you will see what I mean
2014-09-26T23:44:04  <cosmo> i've noticed
2014-09-26T23:44:19  <samson_> tired, time to sleep for me
2014-09-26T23:44:25  <cosmo> but it's the whole thing, from what i understand change one bit of code on it's own and the whole system grinds up
2014-09-26T23:44:30  <cosmo> okay
2014-09-26T23:44:52  <cosmo> just to hammer this home i just wanna get an ETA for 3.0
2014-09-26T23:44:56  <cosmo> right now it's just 'soon'
2014-09-26T23:45:01  <cosmo> MARKETING YAY
2014-09-26T23:45:12  <techbytes-lenovo> so we can go ahead and release the update as long as op_return is enabled?
2014-09-26T23:45:43  <xawksow> and set to 1kb
2014-09-26T23:45:44  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-26T23:46:08  <samson_> yea
2014-09-26T23:46:37  <samson_> Did all the mining testing work out ok ?
2014-09-26T23:46:44  <techbytes-lenovo> ok, then let's do it.  Get windows and mac clients ready and we'll test on all three pools.
2014-09-26T23:47:05  <xawksow> yea the mining was okay
2014-09-26T23:47:18  <techbytes-lenovo> samson_, that part went well.. we now need to test with the wallet
2014-09-26T23:47:19  <xawksow> sending coins works too
2014-09-26T23:47:55  <samson_> cool, I can help with the testing stage - add a node etc.
2014-09-26T23:48:58  <samson_> Baritus said he will help so I suggest asking him to help to create a Windows / Mac build environment for the qt client - something we can work with in the future - not just a one time build
2014-09-26T23:49:35  <samson_> Then reproduce multiples of this build environment on different machines that we have
2014-09-26T23:49:44  <samson_> vm's if needed
2014-09-26T23:50:13  <samson_> this approach will make things easier in the future
2014-09-26T23:50:52  <samson_> could create a full win/mac build system in a vm and just copy it around
2014-09-26T23:52:12  <xawksow> yea i'm currently trying to do that. not sure when it'S read
2014-09-26T23:52:12  <xawksow> y
2014-09-26T23:52:28  <xawksow> but i'm probably the wrong to do that
2014-09-26T23:52:37  <xawksow> because i can't upload a 20GB vm file
2014-09-26T23:52:46  <xawksow> even 8 gb would take a week
2014-09-26T23:52:47  <xawksow> +.~
2014-09-26T23:53:25  <samson_> I could give you access to a windows server on a gbit connection to do this
2014-09-26T23:53:50  <samson_> save it once done then make it available as a download somewhere
2014-09-26T23:53:59  <xawksow> man that would be great
2014-09-26T23:54:10  <samson_> Ok, we can do that
2014-09-26T23:54:39  <samson_> It's the windows server where I keep my permanent nodes running
2014-09-26T23:54:51  <xawksow> some of the dgc seed nodes?
2014-09-26T23:55:26  <samson_> Not sure if it's added as a seed node but it should be - been online since last year
2014-09-26T23:56:17  <samson_> I have DGC, SRC and ARG, BTC and DOGE running on there at the moment, maybe LTC too -can't remember on that one
2014-09-26T23:56:23  <xawksow> lol
2014-09-26T23:57:00  <xawksow> we will add that then into v3 as a seednode
2014-09-26T23:57:12  <samson_> Ok
2014-09-27T00:01:13  <ahmed_> cosmo: easy
2014-09-27T00:01:20  <ahmed_> it all depends on the time to code that change
2014-09-27T00:01:54  <samson_> some of these code changes can be tiny, others not so much
2014-09-27T00:02:21  <cosmo> okay
2014-09-27T00:02:45  <cosmo> would it help if i put on a cheerleading outfit and danced for you guys
2014-09-27T00:03:11  <samson_> for example - op_return = a few lines of code if I remember but the multi algorithm is a shit load of code right Ahmed ?
2014-09-27T00:05:49  <cosmo> yeah, i understand the system of code
2014-09-27T00:07:55  <cosmo> (obviously) since we're a fork of bitcoin the code should be interchangable, just dunno how much multi-algo influences everything else
2014-09-27T00:09:10  <cosmo> if we're gonna use tx fees in op_return, would the random algo blocks interfere with that, etc..
2014-09-27T00:09:18  <cosmo> etc for ever and ever
2014-09-27T00:10:26  <samson_> op_return is a part of Bitcon core, ahmed_ would know more about that
2014-09-27T00:12:10  <ahmed_> nope it wouldnt
2014-09-27T00:12:17  <ahmed_> we just modify the TX Fee algorithm
2014-09-27T00:12:33  <samson_> so that part of it is easy ?
2014-09-27T00:12:42  <ahmed_> (i believe there is one(if there isnt then LTC surely does)
2014-09-27T00:12:54  <ahmed_> hopefully
2014-09-27T00:13:01  <samson_> ok
2014-09-27T00:24:43  <cosmo> as long as there's an eta for the update
2014-09-27T00:25:09  <cosmo> and i'm gonna keep sticking on merged-mining :D
2014-09-27T00:25:16  <samson_> lol
2014-09-27T00:25:50  <cosmo> if anything we can use it as a last-resort tactic, just to have it in words "we're open to merge-mining as a final effort to solidify the network's standing"
2014-09-27T00:26:19  <cosmo> that seems to be what it comes down to, the networks disparity
2014-09-27T00:26:52  <cosmo> disparity/distribution whatever word fits best
2014-09-27T00:26:56  <cosmo> ya know.
2014-09-27T00:27:40  <cosmo> whatever paypal executed decided doge was a good idea needs to have their head rotated
2014-09-27T00:27:56  <cosmo> because it obviously isn't screwed on correctly
2014-09-27T00:29:03  <ahmed_> andd ive fucked the pool up
2014-09-27T00:29:08  <ahmed_> time to get to bed me thinks
2014-09-27T00:29:11  <ahmed_> night all

2014-09-27T12:51:43  <RunningmanZ> Been having a good holiday, till some dickhead ran into my car while it was parked in an empty carpark. :/
2014-09-27T12:52:09  <CoHe> Oo ;(
2014-09-27T12:52:11  <RunningmanZ> Still cant fathom how he managed it. so dumb
2014-09-27T12:52:44  <CoHe> Some people drive with their eyes closed
2014-09-27T12:53:49  <RunningmanZ> had to pull the guard back by hand so the tyre had clearance over the rim. steering is off now too. Was an hour drive with the wheel rubbing on the rim over nearly every bump, just to get back to the resort
2014-09-27T12:54:40  <CoHe> Just material damages?
2014-09-27T12:56:25  <RunningmanZ> nah wheel alignment too and possibly steering/suspension but hopefully only slight as he hit it with some force from the side. the car moved about 2 foot sideways
2014-09-27T12:57:31  <RunningmanZ> at least the dgc price is up so thats some good news
2014-09-27T12:57:37  <CoHe> lolz

2014-09-28T04:52:34  <techbytes> haha, was just reading on bitcoin foundation site... "join the movement..."
2014-09-28T04:53:27  <techbytes> i'm going to rephrase their slogan for my fundraising post... "You are our future"  :)
2014-09-28T04:54:18  <cosmo> how badly RunningmanZ?
2014-09-28T04:55:13  <cosmo> i'm glad for the fundraiser techbytes
2014-09-28T04:55:31  <cosmo> having a development fund will really help boost things
2014-09-28T04:55:46  <techbytes> yep
2014-09-28T04:55:55  <cosmo> especially if it has 250k DGC in it :) you say the foundation will match up to 100k.. i'm down to donate 10-30k
2014-09-28T04:58:41  <RunningmanZ> cosmo:well enough to dent in the front right fender, put the steering out of whack and possible suspension damage. Managed to pull the guard out to stop it rubbing on the tyre to get us frm the national park back to our accommodation, then I got a local mechianic to pull the rest of the guard back out so we could make the 2.5 hr trip back home. Got
2014-09-28T04:58:42  <RunningmanZ> ta go see a smash repair place tomorrow tho
2014-09-28T04:59:22  <techbytes> i was referring myself but sure, foundation would sound better.  So each member can put in whatever they can afford to match.
2014-09-28T04:59:50  <techbytes> but a total of 100k will be matched...
2014-09-28T05:00:19  <cosmo> well depending on the turnout you can count on 30k from me
2014-09-28T05:00:37  <cosmo> hopefully you're insured rz
2014-09-28T05:00:59  <cosmo> i suck at driving :p i bumped a guys bumper a few days ago
2014-09-28T05:01:34  <cosmo> it was raining but i just didn't slow down fast enough. i fucked up my depth perception sitting in front of a computer so long.
2014-09-28T05:04:05  <RunningmanZ> cosmo:yeah this guy as just a goose. Hit our car in an empty car park. How the fark do you do that??

2014-09-28T05:04:52  <cosmo> did he leave a note or hit and run?
2014-09-28T05:08:19  <techbytes> he was probably tweetting or reading his email...
2014-09-28T06:27:17  <RunningmanZ> cosmo:sorry had to go out. He left a note luckily

2014-09-28T12:42:18  <xawksow> but i assume it is just a wrong imported setting

2014-09-28T13:29:42  <samson_> I have to click twice to get them back in order

2014-09-28T13:32:45  <samson_> Ok, I know what it is
2014-09-28T13:33:01  <samson_> The default 'sort order' is by 'Title'
2014-09-28T13:33:07  <samson_> Title, Ascending
2014-09-28T13:33:27  <samson_> So the threads appear in alphabetical order

2014-09-28T13:39:21  <xawksow> yea i've set every forum now to by last post desc
2014-09-28T13:39:33  <xawksow> but i noticed that i need to change some forums manually for my user
2014-09-28T13:40:42  <samson_> It's not working on Digitalcoin -> Discussion
2014-09-28T13:40:47  <samson_> Still the same order
2014-09-28T13:41:16  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-28T13:41:22  <xawksow> that is my problem forum too
2014-09-28T13:41:22  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-28T13:41:35  <samson_> When the page is displayed I can see the 'sort arrow' to the right of 'Title' in the headers and it's pointing 'up'
2014-09-28T13:42:20  <samson_> Perhaps the import process has created an override for existing users intheir db records ?
2014-09-28T13:44:04  <xawksow> seems to work now
2014-09-28T13:44:20  <samson_> Settings->General Settings has a 'Thread Display Options' area which is set to 'Linear - Oldest First' for my account
2014-09-28T13:44:41  <xawksow> that is correct
2014-09-28T13:44:45  <xawksow> don't change that
2014-09-28T13:44:45  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-28T13:44:54  <samson_> ok
2014-09-28T13:45:03  <xawksow> That means, that if you open a thread, you see the oldest post first
2014-09-28T13:45:23  <xawksow> as usual
2014-09-28T13:45:32  <samson_> Ok, I see
2014-09-28T13:46:06  <xawksow> ok, looks like every forum is now in correct order
2014-09-28T13:46:39  <samson_> Yes, looks ok to me now
2014-09-28T13:47:45  <xawksow> perfect :>
2014-09-28T13:54:21  <RunningmanZ> hey guys
2014-09-28T13:54:47  <RunningmanZ> Forum is good. however any chance of changing the background to white? :D
2014-09-28T13:55:49  <RunningmanZ> I guess its a majority thing to decide but I find the darker stuff a bit harder on the eyes. Or maybe thats just me getting old :P
2014-09-28T14:00:37  <samson_> I changed mine to white using the setting at the bottom
2014-09-28T14:00:51  <samson_> It would be better if it defaulted to white
2014-09-28T14:02:19  <RunningmanZ> Yeah I agree default to white would be nice
2014-09-28T14:02:19  <samson_> I selected 'Standard Styles / Default Style' - it was on 'Morbid' something or other before I changed it
2014-09-28T14:02:59  <RunningmanZ> samson_:My rift should be delivered this week!
2014-09-28T14:03:44  <samson_> cool, how do you know - do they email you ahead of charging you for it / mailing it out ?
2014-09-28T14:08:33  <samson_> because I've heard nothing from Oculus at all since placing my order
2014-09-28T14:08:43  <RunningmanZ> yeah as soon as its ready to ship you will get this email.
2014-09-28T14:08:44  <RunningmanZ> http://snag.gy/9JbFY.jpg
2014-09-28T14:08:49  <samson_> just the initial confirmation
2014-09-28T14:09:00  <RunningmanZ> you should be able to log into your order page tho
2014-09-28T14:09:20  <samson_> ok, I'll check that this week sometime

2014-09-28T14:09:58  <RunningmanZ> Yeah yours will probably say pending
2014-09-28T14:11:02  <xawksow> The Morbid Blue theme is a bright one too
2014-09-28T14:11:09  <xawksow> only the morbid dark is dark as fuck
2014-09-28T14:11:18  <xawksow> but thats what was requested here in irc
2014-09-28T14:11:18  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-28T14:11:35  <samson_> meh, these days light backgrounds are all the rage
2014-09-28T14:11:40  <xawksow> i will mod the morbid blue a bit too, fancy background or something
2014-09-28T14:11:41  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-28T14:11:42  <xawksow> i know
2014-09-28T14:12:17  <xawksow> lol i guess your topstats are fucked up
2014-09-28T14:14:06  <xawksow> fixed.
2014-09-28T14:14:40  <xawksow> samson_ which one do you prefer for a bright theme, the default one or morbid blue?
2014-09-28T14:18:36  <samson_> default is what I'm using, the morbid one sucks
2014-09-28T14:19:13  <xawksow> ok xD
2014-09-28T14:19:45  <samson_> I'm not sure which one it was on before though, whatever it was I just changed it to default
2014-09-28T14:19:53  <samson_> I didn't check the others
2014-09-28T14:20:12  <xawksow> hm okay

2014-09-28T15:04:28  <xawksow> i want to set that to default
2014-09-28T15:12:28  <cosmo> i prefer darker backgrounds myself but yeah... i guess white is what's popular..
2014-09-28T15:12:57  <cosmo> it does make the text stand out better, easier to read for the normies
2014-09-28T15:13:38  <cosmo> morbid blue should probably be default, i can still change the theme for myself
2014-09-28T15:13:42  <cosmo> so no biggie
2014-09-28T15:20:30  <xawksow> okay perfect
2014-09-28T15:20:33  <xawksow> so morbid blue is now default

2014-09-28T19:42:43  <cosmo> it's okay, it's something I could do alone. I think would work best if we all shared the email, so we all know what is happening.
2014-09-28T20:45:59  <techbytes> cosmo, use contact@digitalcoin.foundation

2014-09-29T01:41:45  <kenel> LeSean McCoy rushed 10 times for 17 yards on caught zero passes in Sunday's Week 4 loss at San Francisco.
2014-09-29T01:42:22  <kenel> Vernon Davis left Sunday's Week 4 game against the Eagles in the third quarter with a back injury and will not return.
2014-09-29T02:02:05  <techbytes1_> saw the game... thought eagles would go 4-0 after 21-10 lead...

2014-09-29T22:00:44  <ahmed_uni> i dont remember the settings myself LOL
2014-09-29T22:03:30  <techbytes> actually, it was port limit on the pool that you showed me... i'll google it.
2014-09-29T22:10:31  <techbytes> is ulimit same as open_files_limit?
2014-09-29T22:10:37  <ahmed_uni> yep
2014-09-29T22:10:53  <techbytes> i already changed it to 1 million
2014-09-29T22:10:54  <kenel-work> is your my.cnf properly configured?
2014-09-29T22:11:11  <ahmed_uni> techbytes: u restarted mysql after it?
2014-09-29T22:11:16  <techbytes> it's similar to the original cryptopools I box
2014-09-29T22:11:27  <kenel-work> same server specs?
2014-09-29T22:11:39  <techbytes> yeah has been restarted...
2014-09-29T22:11:59  <techbytes> similar spec except it's ubuntu instead of debian
2014-09-29T22:12:17  <ahmed_uni> bad choice ofos
2014-09-29T22:12:20  <ahmed_uni> *of os
2014-09-29T22:12:35  <kenel-work> is the data file path and data home dir proper?
2014-09-29T22:12:48  <kenel-work> i believe debian <> ubuntu file storage paths

2014-09-29T22:14:24  <kenel-work> right but innodb might not be installed properly

2014-09-29T22:14:40  <kenel-work> i'm not sure, but i don't know if innodb is installed by default on debian
2014-09-29T22:14:43  <kenel-work> i don't think it is
2014-09-29T22:14:46  <ahmed_uni> it should be
2014-09-29T22:14:54  <ahmed_uni> because ive never manually installed it

2014-09-29T22:29:45  <xawksow> imo it looks like either you got the wrong user on your data files
2014-09-29T22:29:49  <xawksow> or just the wrong permissions
2014-09-29T22:30:02  <xawksow> mebe i'm wrong
2014-09-29T22:30:20  <xawksow> but i had nearly the same problem and it just was the wrong user in the my.cnf
2014-09-29T22:36:48  <techbytes> wrong user in my.cnf?  what user are you referring to?
2014-09-29T22:37:27  <techbytes> kenel-work, haven't try moving my.cnf... will try on the next crash

2014-09-29T22:45:10  <kenel-work> just a thought though

2014-09-29T23:14:59  <samson2> Did the disk become full at any point for this mysql issue - this will destroy innodb databases - the restoration / rebuilding process is long and painful but it can be done
2014-09-29T23:16:33  <vinje> ^ truth.  30 days on the phone w/ microsoft premiere support with 0 resolution.  I eventually gave up and the tech just sighed in relief.
2014-09-29T23:17:47  <techbytes1_> no, plenty of disk space
2014-09-29T23:18:06  *** ahmed_uni is now known as ahmed_
2014-09-29T23:18:12  <techbytes1_> less than 30gb of 160
2014-09-29T23:18:37  <vinje> what is the actual symptom?  I'll help you look?  I came late to the conversation.
2014-09-29T23:19:30  <techbytes1_> mysql constantly crashes.. how i tell is my pool frontend will not load.. just a white blank page
2014-09-29T23:19:44  <techbytes1_> restart mysql brings the frontend back
2014-09-29T23:22:45  <techbytes1_> this is in the log before the crash:

2014-09-29T23:25:18  <techbytes1_> is it normal for mysqld_safe to run after mysql crashed?
2014-09-29T23:26:21  <vinje> sounds like it makes sense.
2014-09-29T23:26:23  <vinje> :)
2014-09-29T23:26:24  <vinje> There are two solutions to this particular problem:
2014-09-29T23:26:25  <vinje> Restore the my.cnf file to its original state, with an innodb_log_file_size equal to the actual size of the existing InnoDB log files.
2014-09-29T23:26:25  <vinje> Rename or move both the ./ib_logfile0 and ./ib_logfile1 files, and then start the MySQL server.
2014-09-29T23:26:29  <vinje> You tried both of those?
2014-09-29T23:26:54  <techbytes1_> only tried the second
2014-09-29T23:27:32  <techbytes1_> restore my.cnf to original state by renaming it and restart mysql?

2014-09-29T23:27:51  <vinje> From that
2014-09-29T23:31:32  <techbytes1_> the article only says restore the my.cnf to its original state but not how...
2014-09-29T23:31:38  <vinje> yeah
2014-09-29T23:32:02  <vinje> Everything else I'm reading is showing deleting the IB_logfiles.  1, 2, 3, 4, etc
2014-09-29T23:32:19  <vinje> olution: Go to the data directory and remove log files look like ib_logfile0, ib_logfile1 and ib_logfile2.  Then start mysql, this fixed the issue.
2014-09-29T23:32:19  <vinje> Starting MySQL.. SUCCESS!
2014-09-29T23:32:32  <techbytes1_> i have no problem restarting mysql
2014-09-29T23:32:33  <vinje> 4th article in a row for that message.
2014-09-29T23:32:37  <techbytes1_>  it's keeping it running
2014-09-29T23:33:55  <vinje> what version are you using?
2014-09-29T23:34:39  <vinje> actually nm
2014-09-30T00:13:57  <kenel> techbytes1_ to restore my.cnf to its original state
2014-09-30T00:14:07  <kenel> all you're doing is renaming your current my.cnf to my.cnf.bak
2014-09-30T00:14:18  <kenel> and when you restart, there's no my.cnf, so it loads default values
2014-09-30T00:15:25  <kenel> can you upload your my.cnf to pastebin techbytes1_ ?

2014-09-30T02:10:57  <xawksow> well i tried different things, but that is probably the php code

2014-09-30T17:24:03  <kenel-work> sigh, why would you go and stir up something with bcx who takes anything you say and twists it to fit his agenda
2014-09-30T17:37:50  <cosmo> for the lulz

2014-09-30T19:33:16  <cosmo> hey techbytes is a test network set up now?
2014-09-30T19:33:42  <xawksow> cosmo yes
2014-09-30T19:33:43  <xawksow> but
2014-09-30T19:33:54  <xawksow> we should not fire that up
2014-09-30T19:34:07  <xawksow> because the v2 nodes and mixed v3 nodes could fuck something up
2014-09-30T19:34:13  <xawksow> i'm not quite sure what happens
2014-09-30T19:34:13  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-30T19:34:31  <cosmo> ah so people would update to v3 anyway and screw with mainnet?
2014-09-30T19:34:56  <xawksow> after the fork block they are on private main net, but the v2 nodes try to get some infos from v3
2014-09-30T19:35:02  <xawksow> and v3 says fuck you i dont understand your shit
2014-09-30T19:35:11  <xawksow> and v2 gets confused
2014-09-30T19:35:12  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-30T19:35:19  <xawksow> probably nothing bad will happen
2014-09-30T19:35:27  <cosmo> gotcha
2014-09-30T19:35:31  <xawksow> but i don't want to test that right now
2014-09-30T19:35:38  <xawksow> because if something bad will happen, we are all screwed
2014-09-30T19:35:38  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-30T19:36:24  <cosmo> how hard would it be for the foundation to set up 5-6 different temporary pools, and let people connect to that.. or duh would they still need v3 to mine anyway
2014-09-30T19:37:02  <xawksow> well i can setup a nodejs pool pretty fast for our 3 algorithms.
2014-09-30T19:37:07  <xawksow> but
2014-09-30T19:37:14  <xawksow> without a v3 windows wallet they can't receive coins
2014-09-30T19:37:24  <xawksow> so v3 windows wallet needs to be done before that
2014-09-30T19:37:39  <cosmo> you're already on it then is what you're saying :p
2014-09-30T19:37:45  <cosmo> could ask baritus to help us make the wallet
2014-09-30T19:37:49  <cosmo> if you haven't already
2014-09-30T19:37:52  <xawksow> i don't think we need that
2014-09-30T19:37:55  <xawksow> got a pretty good guide
2014-09-30T19:38:04  <xawksow> that should make it easy once i compiled every dependency
2014-09-30T19:38:13  <xawksow> samsons server is insanely fast
2014-09-30T19:38:15  <xawksow> that helps alot
2014-09-30T19:38:16  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-30T19:38:21  <cosmo> super
2014-09-30T19:38:35  <cosmo> i mean he offered help, no reason to turn down perfectly good manpower
2014-09-30T19:38:39  <cosmo> cuz we fuckin need it
2014-09-30T19:38:47  <xawksow> yea, sure
2014-09-30T19:38:47  <cosmo> it's pretty much just you samson_ and ahmed_
2014-09-30T19:38:51  <xawksow> yea
2014-09-30T19:38:52  <cosmo> and ahmed_ is in school
2014-09-30T19:38:54  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-30T19:39:07  <xawksow> and i'm away soon
2014-09-30T19:39:07  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-30T19:39:17  <xawksow> and because of that i need to get my shit down before that
2014-09-30T19:39:18  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-30T19:39:30  <cosmo> how long are you gone for?
2014-09-30T19:39:35  <xawksow> 14 days
2014-09-30T19:39:47  <xawksow> but i will be online with my smartphone
2014-09-30T19:39:53  <xawksow> but can'T do much stuff
2014-09-30T19:40:43  <cosmo> okay, 14 days isn't bad
2014-09-30T19:40:52  <cosmo> i was thinking gone forever :<
2014-09-30T19:41:27  <cosmo> finish your deadline >:@
2014-09-30T19:41:45  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-30T19:41:48  <xawksow> i'm on it <3
2014-09-30T19:44:03  <cosmo> yay
2014-09-30T19:51:24  <xawksow> btw
2014-09-30T19:51:33  <xawksow> w0lf is a good developer
2014-09-30T19:51:35  <xawksow> wolf
2014-09-30T19:51:36  <xawksow> derp
2014-09-30T19:51:43  <xawksow> would be a good addition
2014-09-30T19:51:53  <xawksow> but i don't know if he would join us
2014-09-30T19:52:18  <cosmo> i'll bug him
2014-09-30T19:52:22  <cosmo> we can bond over furry porn
2014-09-30T19:53:09  <kenel-work> the fuck
2014-09-30T19:53:18  <kenel-work> glancing at this screen once in a while is bad for your mental health
2014-09-30T19:53:31  <cosmo> lazy ass president
2014-09-30T19:53:40  <kenel-work> also wolf likes me
2014-09-30T19:53:50  <kenel-work> but i wouldn't be quick to add him to 'foundation' if that makes sense
2014-09-30T19:54:02  <kenel-work> also kiss my shiny metal ass
2014-09-30T19:54:04  <cosmo> man i don't even know why i'm here
2014-09-30T19:54:07  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-30T19:54:36  <kenel-work> a true pessimist is always pessimistic about him/herself
2014-09-30T19:54:44  <kenel-work> that's commitment
2014-09-30T19:54:55  <xawksow> so short form is because you are criticizing everything
2014-09-30T19:54:57  <cosmo> thanks? i appreciate ya
2014-09-30T19:55:00  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-30T19:55:15  <cosmo> what
2014-09-30T19:55:51  <cosmo> emdes says he would dev for us
2014-09-30T19:55:57  <cosmo> kenel-work what's one gotta do to join the foundation?
2014-09-30T19:56:09  <xawksow> maybe the application form?
2014-09-30T19:56:18  <xawksow> + we need to see what he can give us
2014-09-30T19:56:25  <xawksow> like his skills
2014-09-30T19:56:37  <ahmed_> dont think wolf has ever worked with the bitcoin source
2014-09-30T19:56:54  <ahmed_> otherwise he wouldve attempted to port tenebrix over with lolcust
2014-09-30T19:57:03  <ahmed_> and emdes couldnt code for shit
2014-09-30T19:57:11  <xawksow> lol
2014-09-30T19:57:16  <xawksow> just saw wolfs skills @ opencl
2014-09-30T19:57:20  <xawksow> and that wasn't bad at all
2014-09-30T19:57:52  <kenel-work> at this point, we're not accepting new members unless we all agree to accept new members
2014-09-30T19:58:04  <xawksow> oh sweet
2014-09-30T19:58:11  <xawksow> basic democracy
2014-09-30T19:58:13  <kenel-work> we're all busy with the new 3.0 we haven't gotten a chance to discuss entries, etc
2014-09-30T19:58:30  <kenel-work> at some point, maybe when we get to this bank idea, we will have commitments, etc.
2014-09-30T19:58:37  <kenel-work> but for now, we just need to keep rolling with 3.0
2014-09-30T19:58:55  <cosmo> we're not really rolling, ahmed_ did the work and now we're sitting with it
2014-09-30T19:59:19  <xawksow> we need to update dgc to the last bitcoin source
2014-09-30T19:59:20  <cosmo> more like jiggling
2014-09-30T19:59:24  <kenel-work> so my understanding is that xawksow is doing the windows wallet this week?
2014-09-30T19:59:28  <xawksow> and are setting up a build env
2014-09-30T19:59:38  <xawksow> i'm doing the setup of the environment, yes
2014-09-30T19:59:50  <xawksow> and with that, we can compile a wallet everytime something is changed
2014-09-30T19:59:51  <cosmo> could we have this discussion in #digitalcoin
2014-09-30T19:59:53  <xawksow> wihout much problems
2014-09-30T19:59:53  <kenel-work> also ahmed_ has a few other commitments between now and the end of the next week
2014-09-30T20:00:17  <kenel-work> not sure how that benefits coming back into a conversation in another room that's 1/2 way done
2014-09-30T20:01:52  <ahmed_> yep
2014-09-30T20:02:14  <ahmed_> gotta finish up coding these stupid unit tests for this pool frontend, then learn how to use MPOS before hashers united
2014-09-30T20:02:38  <xawksow> mpos is easy
2014-09-30T20:02:47  <xawksow> you dont need to learn how mpos works
2014-09-30T20:02:52  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-30T20:02:58  <ahmed_> xawksow: ive not set one up in months
2014-09-30T20:04:43  <kenel-work> also cosmo, we asked a lot of ahmed_ to take this over, and we have to respect his previous commitments
2014-09-30T20:05:04  <kenel-work> so while i understand that two weeks in IRC time is like a year, when you're important enough (as DGC is, and will be), people will wait
2014-09-30T20:05:29  <xawksow> and pushing out new stuff which isn't properly tested results in a mess
2014-09-30T20:05:35  <ahmed_> ^^
2014-09-30T20:05:39  <xawksow> so better take that time to fix everything properly
2014-09-30T20:08:53  <samson_> There's no point in rushing anything, when it's done, it's done
2014-09-30T20:09:31  <cosmo> yeah yeah, i'm well aware
2014-09-30T20:09:41  <cosmo> anyone else think there'll be another december rush like there was last year?
2014-09-30T20:09:52  <xawksow> would be awesome
2014-09-30T20:09:58  <xawksow> but i don't think so
2014-09-30T20:10:15  <cosmo> oh well
2014-09-30T20:10:23  <samson_> I'd also like to pick up a few hundred thousand cheap DGC over the next couple of months
2014-09-30T20:10:38  <xawksow> ^
2014-09-30T20:10:49  <ahmed_> by december tho we should be well into testing
2014-09-30T20:11:02  <xawksow> i think in december we are nearly done with everything
2014-09-30T20:11:03  <ahmed_> if not finished and released
2014-09-30T20:11:07  <xawksow> ! :D
2014-09-30T20:11:21  <ahmed_> multi-algo we should be able to put a test pool up this week
2014-09-30T20:11:28  <ahmed_> (it helps both dgc, and me :D)
2014-09-30T20:11:43  <cosmo> awesome
2014-09-30T20:11:49  <ahmed_> (i need to fix the hashrates and test everything on my frontend so this makes it easier)
2014-09-30T20:12:04  <cosmo> so long as we can prove something's happening, we should publish that ETA
2014-09-30T20:12:15  <xawksow> oh cosmo
2014-09-30T20:12:23  <cosmo> yeah blame me
2014-09-30T20:12:24  <xawksow> please publish a splashscreen contest today
2014-09-30T20:12:25  <xawksow> !
2014-09-30T20:12:26  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-30T20:12:47  <cosmo> ho'kay, not sure how badly we need a splashscreen
2014-09-30T20:12:55  <cosmo> what're the requirements? 500x500 px or what
2014-09-30T20:12:58  <xawksow> me neither
2014-09-30T20:13:22  <cosmo> i'd like to run techbytes' fundraiser first, where we can list bounties for things like a splashscreen
2014-09-30T20:13:26  <cosmo> get people involved
2014-09-30T20:15:21  <xawksow> hm
2014-09-30T20:18:15  <techbytes1_> no ETA.. we just tell them we are building the env for the windows wallet and getting the three test pools up and running.  Then whoever wants to test can do so.
2014-09-30T20:19:37  <cosmo> okay
2014-09-30T20:53:26  <techbytes1_> we are not seeing much traffic on the new forum maybe because people don't want to go through the password reset process
2014-09-30T20:54:34  <cosmo> probably
2014-09-30T20:55:44  <cosmo> i don't see why it'd get any more active
2014-09-30T20:57:59  <techbytes1_> no but should at least be as active as before the move...
2014-09-30T21:00:17  <cosmo> 'oh i'm sure other people are doing the work'
2014-09-30T21:00:25  <cosmo> 'there's no need for little ol me to post'
2014-09-30T21:18:20  <kenel-work> i will post it; is it possible to make an animated slpash screen?
2014-09-30T21:18:32  <kenel-work> is it even allowed to post something like that on BCT?
2014-09-30T21:38:21  <CoHe> Good night all

2014-09-30T22:14:54  <techbytes1_> not going to give them a reason to ban... especially when bcx can encourage them to.
2014-09-30T22:19:53  <techbytes1_> cosmo, you need to create a new thread for the bounties/giveaway...
2014-09-30T22:48:42  <kenel-work> !seen baritus

2014-09-30T22:56:53  <kenel-work> You guys wanted exposure, take the effort and keep responding about about all the improvements post baritus.
2014-09-30T22:56:53  <kenel-work> I will educate the masses how bad it was
2014-09-30T22:56:54  <kenel-work> You will educate the masses on good it will be. X11, democratic, etc..

2014-09-30T22:56:54  <kenel-work> ~BCX~
2014-09-30T22:57:24  <ahmed_> haha
2014-09-30T22:57:35  <samson_> Yeah, looks like he wants to continue to bash Baritus while hoping the coin does ok
2014-09-30T22:58:10  <ahmed_> he'd love to continue to bash baritus
2014-09-30T22:58:15  <ahmed_> and i dont see why not really
2014-09-30T22:58:43  <ahmed_> by bashing baritus with us showing how great DGC Is without him, shows a massive improvement
2014-09-30T23:01:13  <kenel-work> well i will not bash baritus
2014-09-30T23:01:27  <kenel-work> i believe my answers to him have been pretty diplomatic :P
2014-09-30T23:01:55  <ahmed_> heh i will when i have good reason to :P
2014-09-30T23:02:36  <kenel-work> yeah, well, at some point you have to realize what we're doing here stays online for good for the most part
2014-09-30T23:02:50  <kenel-work> you don't want something you said 2-3 years ago to hit you in the ass in the future
2014-09-30T23:02:53  <kenel-work> just saying...
2014-09-30T23:02:56  <ahmed_> true
2014-09-30T23:03:34  <ahmed_> although i havent said much besides stating that baritus is full of shit :P
2014-09-30T23:06:03  <kenel-work> still doesn't look good phrased that way
2014-09-30T23:06:20  <ahmed_> meh maybe
2014-09-30T23:06:38  <ahmed_> no matter what way you put it it wont ever look good
2014-09-30T23:12:57  <cosmo> things weren't awful with baritus, he just refused to work with other people
2014-09-30T23:13:31  <cosmo> his worst trait was turning down good help, the theft thing is moot imo
2014-09-30T23:14:15  <ahmed_> theft is moot
2014-09-30T23:14:31  <ahmed_> but the little work/missng of deadlines was what pissed me off the most
2014-09-30T23:14:36  <cosmo> techbytes you posted a giveaway thread on the dgc forums right? it'd be better if you posted it, more diversity in posters under DGC
2014-09-30T23:14:46  <cosmo> ahmed_ yeah
2014-09-30T23:15:14  <cosmo> we were free to do what we wanted all along but at the same time he had monopoly over the github soooo fuck that.
2014-09-30T23:15:55  <cosmo> it's a normal human trait to stand ones ground, meh, glad he came around to publicly stepping himself down but shoulda happened way earlier in the year
2014-09-30T23:16:03  <ahmed_> agreed
2014-09-30T23:16:27  <cosmo> i'll just fire up the ol time machine and fix everything

2014-09-30T23:48:10  <techbytes> cosmo no on the giveaway thread. Only fundraising so far.
2014-09-30T23:48:31  <cosmo> ah yeah, i derped, meant fundraiser
2014-09-30T23:48:46  <cosmo> fundraiser with potential bounties should some goal be met?
2014-09-30T23:49:04  <cosmo> we're not gonna get many donations outside the community that already exists imo
2014-09-30T23:58:30  <techbytes>  i have the three frontends up for the test pools.  Once we are ready, I will get the NOMP stratum going.

2014-10-01T00:07:22  <kenel> if we want people to reset their passwords, we need to offer a 100 dgc bonus for their first post to the new forum
2014-10-01T00:07:30  <kenel> just fyi
2014-10-01T00:10:15  <vinje> retroactive? :P
2014-10-01T00:10:53  <techbytes1_> i guess that's the only way to get them to do it...
2014-10-01T00:11:26  <vinje> Just need a reason to get them to the forums
2014-10-01T00:11:33  <xawksow> well
2014-10-01T00:11:37  <vinje> add a roulette wheel or something
2014-10-01T00:11:39  <vinje> mini games
2014-10-01T00:11:40  <xawksow> i found a credit mod

2014-10-01T00:12:41  <xawksow> that instead of virtual credits
2014-10-01T00:12:42  <xawksow> with dgc
2014-10-01T00:15:55  <vinje> That could be cool.  Have you seen hashtalk's hashpoints?  User upvotes get you extra, downvotes take them away etc.  You only have 20 to allocate either way daily
2014-10-01T00:21:01  <xawksow>  yea
2014-10-01T00:21:07  <xawksow> but we cant give them 20 dgc per day
2014-10-01T00:21:08  <xawksow> :D
2014-10-01T00:23:09  <xawksow> well
2014-10-01T00:23:16  <xawksow> we could create digitalcoin community points
2014-10-01T00:23:24  <xawksow> and let them buy some with dgc
2014-10-01T00:23:30  <xawksow> then that would be possible
2014-10-01T00:26:10  <vinje> man, rubycoin disabled.
2014-10-01T00:28:42  <techbytes1_> don't know why you were mining that.
2014-10-01T00:30:32  <techbytes1_> kenel, when you get a chance, text rawdawg and get the logon info for twitter account.  I skyped him but not reply
2014-10-01T00:33:47  <cosmo> probably od'd on meds
2014-10-01T00:35:12  <vinje> You're cheerful today cosmo lol
2014-10-01T00:36:48  <kenel> k, give me a min
2014-10-01T00:40:35  <kenel> so i have a question
2014-10-01T00:40:45  <kenel> why is it that bcx never publicly replies to my comments?
2014-10-01T00:47:12  <xawksow> because he is only a wild pokemon
2014-10-01T00:47:20  <xawksow> you need to catch em all
2014-10-01T00:47:26  <xawksow> !!111
2014-10-01T00:50:26  <kenel> no seriously though
2014-10-01T00:50:26  <kenel> he just never replies
2014-10-01T00:50:26  <kenel> i mean i don't care, but is he not used to well thought out comebacks to his bullshit?
2014-10-01T00:50:26  <kenel> i don't get it
2014-10-01T00:50:26  <xawksow> lol samsons server is @ 80% cpu while compiling qt
2014-10-01T00:50:27  <xawksow> kenel, i don't get that too
2014-10-01T00:50:27  <xawksow> but i think is he's only a stupid troll
2014-10-01T00:50:27  <xawksow> he said in his last 3 posts nearly the same shi
2014-10-01T00:50:27  <xawksow> t
2014-10-01T00:50:27  <xawksow> i don't take that guy seriously at all
2014-10-01T01:00:00  <samson_> good server ha ?

2014-10-01T01:00:36  <xawksow> yea its really nice
2014-10-01T01:00:53  <samson_> It's tiny compared to the linux beasts !
2014-10-01T01:02:09  <xawksow> give me one of them for DGC gameservers! :D
2014-10-01T01:02:44  <techbytes> i ran out of ideas last night so i reboot the vps again and mysql hasn't crashed since...  knocking on some wood here...
2014-10-01T01:02:54  <xawksow> lol nice
2014-10-01T01:04:13  <techbytes> so maybe the open files limit didn't take affect until the reboot... it's nice to not have to babysit the pools.
2014-10-01T01:04:24  <xawksow> yep
2014-10-01T01:06:27  <kenel> soooooooooooooo

2014-10-01T01:06:46  <samson_> ?
2014-10-01T01:06:53  <kenel> he said it was either danny disco or mikey
2014-10-01T01:06:56  <kenel> that's why he isn't around
2014-10-01T01:07:04  <kenel> said he'd be around next week i believe after he gets his internet up
2014-10-01T01:08:10  <cosmo> betcha she was a gold digger
2014-10-01T01:08:20  <cosmo> good to hear raw's okay
2014-10-01T01:08:45  <kenel> yeah, everyone thought my wife was a gold digger
2014-10-01T01:08:48  <kenel> now she makes more money than me
2014-10-01T01:08:52  <kenel> funny how life goes :P
2014-10-01T01:09:11  <cosmo> you were rich before?
2014-10-01T01:09:17  <kenel> her bonuses are about my annual salary
2014-10-01T01:09:25  <kenel> no man, if you own a large family business everyone thinks you're rich
2014-10-01T01:09:34  <kenel> we pay ourselves well, but we invest most of the money back into our company
2014-10-01T01:09:50  <kenel> well call those people truck counters
2014-10-01T01:10:00  <kenel> because we have ~ 60 trucks/trailers
2014-10-01T01:10:07  <cosmo> hah, yeah i see
2014-10-01T01:10:18  <cosmo> there's a good store around here that's slooowly dying, which is sad, boscovs
2014-10-01T01:10:22  <kenel> if i ever got into trouble, i'd never lose anything
2014-10-01T01:10:27  <kenel> we just prefer to not pay ourselves too much
2014-10-01T01:10:34  <kenel> government sucks anyway
2014-10-01T01:10:41  <cosmo> eyyyyyup
2014-10-01T01:10:46  <cosmo> too big to fail

2014-10-01T01:11:15  <cosmo> i paid too much for my 02 corolla
2014-10-01T01:11:25  <kenel> rather spend that money on my daughter's education

2014-10-01T01:17:13  <cosmo> i gotta invent the next velcro or something
2014-10-01T01:17:13  <kenel> techbytes you want vernon davis?
2014-10-01T01:17:25  <kenel> i'm going to trade him and pierre thomas to someone; want to know if you want him
2014-10-01T01:17:27  <techbytes> i need to check my roster.
2014-10-01T01:17:44  <cosmo> can i get buzz aldrin on my team
2014-10-01T01:17:45  <kenel> all i want is a RB or WR
2014-10-01T01:18:01  <kenel> i'm short on RBs
2014-10-01T01:18:51  <kenel> davis is hurt, but a good fill in for ertz
2014-10-01T01:19:34  <kenel> i mean he's like 1 week hurt
2014-10-01T01:19:35  <kenel> not hurt hurt
2014-10-01T01:19:52  <techbytes> who do you want for davis?
2014-10-01T01:21:14  <kenel> thomas comes with him :P
2014-10-01T01:21:25  <kenel> nah, i hate thomas, i wouldn't give him to my worst enemy
2014-10-01T01:21:44  <kenel> how about randle; i need a WR without a week 9 bye
2014-10-01T01:22:09  <techbytes> i don't like thomas... i can let randle go..
2014-10-01T01:22:48  <techbytes> you got yourself a trade.
2014-10-01T01:23:16  <kenel> holy fucking shit
2014-10-01T01:23:25  <kenel> it's the first trade ever in the history of our league
2014-10-01T01:23:28  <kenel> lol
2014-10-01T01:23:31  <techbytes> hahaha
2014-10-01T01:23:37  <techbytes> can't be
2014-10-01T01:23:51  <techbytes> didn't i traded with you last season?
2014-10-01T01:25:15  <techbytes> you traded me someone who was hurt then came back and put up some nice points.
2014-10-01T01:26:12  <xawksow> lol
2014-10-01T01:26:19  <kenel> oh wait yeah
2014-10-01T01:26:28  <kenel> i forgot who it was but i was desperate during bye week
2014-10-01T01:28:10  <kenel> i planned out a little better this year but not by much
2014-10-01T01:28:21  <kenel> i think it was round 7 during the draft when i realized all my WRs had week 9 byes
2014-10-01T01:28:42  <kenel> vernon davis will be a top 5 TE this year if he stays healthy; keap looks only for him and crabtree in the red zone
2014-10-01T01:30:08  <kenel> now that i'm 4-0, i have to start re-arranging shit to make sure i don't go 0-10 the rest of the way
2014-10-01T01:30:27  <techbytes> trade accepted
2014-10-01T01:30:27  <kenel> atriz, once again, gets a team with ridiculous points
2014-10-01T01:30:43  <kenel> i don't even think he knows fantasy football that well
2014-10-01T01:30:47  <kenel> i think he just gets fucking lucky, lol
2014-10-01T01:30:48  <techbytes> he lost in the final last season?
2014-10-01T01:30:56  <kenel> who won first?
2014-10-01T01:31:00  <kenel> oh yeah
2014-10-01T01:31:01  <kenel> kras
2014-10-01T01:31:05  <techbytes> yeah
2014-10-01T01:31:06  <kenel> then he disappeared
2014-10-01T01:31:11  <techbytes> haha...
2014-10-01T01:31:18  <techbytes> kras = clap?
2014-10-01T01:31:21  <kenel> well hopefully we keep a lot of these guys around for next year
2014-10-01T01:31:28  <kenel> nah, two different personalities
2014-10-01T01:31:35  <kenel> i don't think clapy could've preteneded to be kras
2014-10-01T01:31:39  <kenel> kras was too much like trenal
2014-10-01T01:31:51  <kenel> you met clapy
2014-10-01T01:32:02  <techbytes> if kras was around, maybe he would know where clapy is
2014-10-01T01:32:12  <kenel> he had the same attitude about life as cosmo, but he was 400lbs
2014-10-01T01:33:06  <kenel> oh shit
2014-10-01T01:33:18  <kenel> i forgot i put it to commish cancelling/accepting trades because no one voted last year
2014-10-01T01:33:24  <kenel> ah well
2014-10-01T01:33:49  <techbytes> now we have to wait for the votes?
2014-10-01T01:33:52  <kenel> no
2014-10-01T01:33:54  <kenel> i approved it
2014-10-01T01:33:57  <techbytes> ha
2014-10-01T01:33:59  <kenel> it's a fair trade
2014-10-01T01:34:11  <kenel> it's not like i'm giving you golden tate for megatron
2014-10-01T01:34:11  <kenel> lol
2014-10-01T01:34:37  <kenel> now if i asked for someone like AJ Green or another high end WR you have
2014-10-01T01:34:40  <kenel> that probably wouldn't be fair
2014-10-01T01:34:45  <kenel> TEs are so hit/miss
2014-10-01T01:34:53  <kenel> gronk even this year is hit/miss
2014-10-01T01:35:06  <kenel> but vernon gets a shitload of looks as long as he's on the field
2014-10-01T01:35:16  <kenel> i have kelce though, i'm rolling with him
2014-10-01T01:35:58  <kenel> going to try to pick up a TE off the WW tonight
2014-10-01T01:36:14  <kenel> and do a few more WW pickups
2014-10-01T01:36:21  <kenel> i don't trust foles to put up 20 pts/game
2014-10-01T01:36:34  <kenel> i'm keeping him, but i need to make sure i have high upsides around in case he doesn't
2014-10-01T01:36:53  <kenel> just fyi, i probably wouldn't play davis this week
2014-10-01T01:36:59  <kenel> give him a week
2014-10-01T01:37:29  <kenel> two weeks from now he plays STL, that'll be the week to start him if you're going to
2014-10-01T01:37:42  <techbytes> delanie walker is hot so i'll use davis on a bye
2014-10-01T01:37:56  <kenel> way better than ertz as a bye fillin, lol
2014-10-01T01:38:07  <techbytes> yeah
2014-10-01T01:38:34  <kenel> you should trade ertz to mobgod
2014-10-01T01:38:45  <techbytes> now i can try and trade ertz for RB
2014-10-01T01:38:49  <kenel> yeah
2014-10-01T01:39:06  <kenel> trade ertz to mobgod for like chris ivory or t rich
2014-10-01T01:39:17  <kenel> oh wait
2014-10-01T01:39:29  <kenel> yeah he needs a backup to orange julius
2014-10-01T01:39:37  <kenel> tim wright put up 0 points
2014-10-01T01:39:42  <kenel> also tell modgod to pay his fucking buyin
2014-10-01T01:40:01  <kenel> actually
2014-10-01T01:40:02  <kenel> techbytes
2014-10-01T01:40:05  <kenel> trade to dizzynugs
2014-10-01T01:40:13  <kenel> he had niles paul and no backup TE
2014-10-01T01:40:28  <kenel> get....
2014-10-01T01:40:32  <kenel> wtf he has no good rbs
2014-10-01T01:40:41  <kenel> asiata
2014-10-01T01:40:48  <kenel> get asiata if you can
2014-10-01T01:41:11  <techbytes> don't think he is giving up asiata
2014-10-01T01:41:47  <kenel> probably not
2014-10-01T01:41:51  <kenel> get ivory from mobgod
2014-10-01T01:41:53  <kenel> that's a good trade
2014-10-01T01:42:12  <kenel> dude
2014-10-01T01:42:13  <kenel> cosmo
2014-10-01T01:42:22  <kenel> you need to set your goddamn lineup
2014-10-01T01:42:49  <techbytes> cosmo giving freebie W...
2014-10-01T01:43:33  <kenel> oh
2014-10-01T01:43:44  <kenel> techbytes, i'm giving you co comish status in case something happens to me
2014-10-01T01:43:50  <kenel> b/c you're the only one i trust ;\
2014-10-01T01:43:59  <kenel> (including out of poleethman)
2014-10-01T01:44:28  <techbytes> haha
2014-10-01T01:45:03  <techbytes> maybe i should trade with cosmo... looks like he needs a TE
2014-10-01T01:46:01  <kenel> cosmo shows now interest because he's 0-4
2014-10-01T01:46:06  <kenel> cosmo, can i set your lineup for this week?
2014-10-01T01:48:59  <kenel> if you say yes, all i have to do is hit submit :P
2014-10-01T01:49:52  <kenel> also cosmo, i think you're the only one i don't have a cell / whatsapp / google number for other than samson
2014-10-01T01:50:09  <kenel> oh, samson_ too
2014-10-01T01:50:25  <kenel> oh and vinje
2014-10-01T01:50:26  <techbytes> is project mayhem t3xploit?
2014-10-01T01:50:27  <kenel> but who cares about vinje
2014-10-01T01:50:39  <techbytes> i play him this week
2014-10-01T01:50:40  <kenel> no, that's jackstraw or jackdaw
2014-10-01T01:50:48  <techbytes> who's that?
2014-10-01T01:51:09  <kenel> he's a rando actually from bittrex
2014-10-01T01:51:20  <kenel> we needed a 12th player when scrappy wouldn't get back to me
2014-10-01T01:52:42  <kenel> cosmo, i hit update; if you don't like it, change it back
2014-10-01T01:52:47  <kenel> but you really need a better TE
2014-10-01T01:53:48  <kenel> we can only have one taco in our league, not three
2014-10-01T01:53:58  <kenel> t3exploit is breez nutz
2014-10-01T01:54:17  <kenel> he told me 'I'm leaving my roster the same until week 7 then i'm going to fuck all you up'
2014-10-01T01:54:18  <kenel> lol
2014-10-01T01:58:30  <vinje> >_<
2014-10-01T02:03:22  <kenel> cosmo, if the trade for a TE is good from techbytes (and he's actually going to do it), i would take it
2014-10-01T02:03:29  <kenel> cameron is dead meat right now
2014-10-01T02:04:20  <kenel> and as long as antonio gates is on SD, ladarius green will barely play a snap
2014-10-01T02:05:07  <xawksow> kenel
2014-10-01T02:05:08  <xawksow> i will play
2014-10-01T02:05:09  <xawksow> :D
2014-10-01T02:05:41  <kenel> ask cosmo if he wants to give up his team/transfer ownership
2014-10-01T02:06:00  <kenel> or you two can play on one team :P
2014-10-01T02:06:18  <xawksow> cosmo i want to be der fhrer of your team
2014-10-01T02:06:31  <kenel> everyone else is actually pretty active except cosmo, poleethman (because he just moved to oregon) and t3exploit because he's being a dick :P
2014-10-01T02:06:38  <xawksow> lol
2014-10-01T02:07:31  <kenel> i set his lineup for this week with what he had on his bench/etc because he hasn't done that since week 1
2014-10-01T02:07:52  <kenel> and i don't want people thinking we're a dead league
2014-10-01T02:07:56  <kenel> i.e. bittrex/flound/etc.
2014-10-01T02:08:01  <xawksow> man i have no clue about that shit
2014-10-01T02:08:07  <xawksow> will just do some retarded trades
2014-10-01T02:08:08  <kenel> it's all numbers man
2014-10-01T02:08:15  <kenel> math and luck
2014-10-01T02:08:29  <xawksow> :>
2014-10-01T02:08:36  <xawksow> okay, then i should win
2014-10-01T02:08:36  <xawksow> XD

2014-10-01T02:11:03  <cosmo> i never figured out how to get mirc to ping me when my name's said
2014-10-01T02:11:10  <cosmo> i don't have a cell phone atm, will soon though
2014-10-01T02:12:07  <kenel> here
2014-10-01T02:12:13  <kenel> i have a foundation job for you if you choose to accept it
2014-10-01T02:12:24  <cosmo> sure
2014-10-01T02:12:28  <kenel> will you be our copywriter?
2014-10-01T02:12:42  <cosmo> what's that entail?
2014-10-01T02:12:47  <kenel> what you do now...
2014-10-01T02:13:01  <kenel> just making an official title
2014-10-01T02:13:08  <techbytes> minus the negative sentiments...
2014-10-01T02:13:13  <kenel> ^ :P
2014-10-01T02:13:14  <techbytes> :)
2014-10-01T02:13:23  <kenel> when you and i write together, that shit comes out awesome
2014-10-01T02:13:51  <kenel> or i should say, when i bounce ideas off you
2014-10-01T02:14:03  <cosmo> puhhhleeze
2014-10-01T02:14:12  <cosmo> you rearranged things i wrote pal
2014-10-01T02:14:16  <kenel> lol i know
2014-10-01T02:14:31  <cosmo> sometimes for the worse >:P not that i really care though
2014-10-01T02:14:39  <kenel> also i didn't realize you rewrote all that
2014-10-01T02:14:43  <kenel> i thought that was baritus'
2014-10-01T02:14:52  <kenel> i would've approached that differently if i knew
2014-10-01T02:15:04  <cosmo> eternal meh
2014-10-01T02:15:07  <kenel> because baritus couldn't write for shit
2014-10-01T02:15:16  <cosmo> he was par
2014-10-01T02:15:29  <kenel> he was 8th grade level, so about the same as the chicago tribune
2014-10-01T02:15:51  <cosmo> my towns newspaper surprisingly isn't that awful
2014-10-01T02:15:51  <kenel> if we want to be who we talk about wanting to be on our conference calls, we need WSJ level
2014-10-01T02:15:54  <kenel> which i think you do
2014-10-01T02:16:03  <cosmo> aw thanks :D
2014-10-01T02:16:06  <kenel> well that's ok, the chicago southtown is written at 3rd grade level
2014-10-01T02:16:28  <kenel> as long as you're ok with me critiqing when necessary
2014-10-01T02:16:45  <cosmo> i don't care, you are helpful sometimes
2014-10-01T02:16:55  <kenel> i think your vocab and writing skills are way above normal; you can probably get a decent job as a freelance writer man
2014-10-01T02:17:05  <kenel> that's how the guy i do DIY Degree with started out
2014-10-01T02:17:10  <cosmo> i could do a lot of things if i had some money
2014-10-01T02:17:17  <kenel> freelance writing costs nothing
2014-10-01T02:17:30  <cosmo> simpsons quote :p
2014-10-01T02:17:49  <cosmo> i'll get my shit together someday
2014-10-01T02:18:02  <cosmo> i enjoy marvelling at life too much to hold down a job
2014-10-01T02:18:11  <kenel> it's not a job
2014-10-01T02:18:26  <kenel> freelance writing is literally doing what you do now, just writing for an hour a day extra to make 20-100$
2014-10-01T02:18:35  <techbytes> work on your own time...
2014-10-01T02:18:40  <kenel> i think jay started out making 20$/article, and built himself up to like 200$/article
2014-10-01T02:18:49  <kenel> he was writing for intuit, mint.com, etc.
2014-10-01T02:19:49  <cosmo> i got brain crabs
2014-10-01T02:19:50  <kenel> guru.com, elance.com, odesk.com, freelancer.com, etc.
2014-10-01T02:20:11  <kenel> my wife used to do freelance writing when she was on maternity leave
2014-10-01T02:20:21  <kenel> making 50$/day via paypal was nice income for us :)
2014-10-01T02:20:51  <techbytes> and don't forget http://forum.digitalcoin.co/blog.php.... :)

2014-10-01T02:21:36  <cosmo> if you wanna put me down as copywright i guess that's fine
2014-10-01T02:21:43  <cosmo> we should emphasize that this whole thing is volunteer run
2014-10-01T02:21:48  <kenel> nah, i'd come up with a better title than that
2014-10-01T02:21:53  <cosmo> shits like bcx are expecting corporate level responsibility
2014-10-01T02:22:12  <kenel> we can give that front even if it's not true
2014-10-01T02:22:20  <kenel> i used to run my hosting company like i had 10 employees, but it was just me
2014-10-01T02:22:32  <kenel> i had all the geeksquad guys on the southside of chicago and western suburbs as my clients
2014-10-01T02:22:36  <kenel> it was awesome income when i was in college
2014-10-01T02:23:26  <kenel> hahaha
2014-10-01T02:23:28  <kenel> the guy kept the domain

2014-10-01T02:23:38  <kenel> he made it look retarded, but it still exists
2014-10-01T02:24:04  <kenel> i sold it a year later for like 12k
2014-10-01T02:24:17  <kenel> used it to start getting my shit ready for marriage
2014-10-01T02:24:49  <cosmo> that's pretty decent
2014-10-01T02:24:56  <cosmo> what year was that?
2014-10-01T02:25:10  <kenel> uhm....
2014-10-01T02:25:54  <kenel> i was a sophomore
2014-10-01T02:25:59  <kenel> so....2004 or 2005?
2014-10-01T02:26:37  <kenel> it was the year after i sold everything i had of value to get my engagement ring
2014-10-01T02:26:48  <kenel> which included my special edition nintendo ;\
2014-10-01T02:27:27  <kenel> i laugh because my engagement ring's nicer than the engagement ring my millionaire friend bought for his fiance and it cost 1/2 as much
2014-10-01T02:28:01  <cosmo> i laught cuz you bought an engagement ring
2014-10-01T02:28:14  <cosmo> if i ever get hitched the only ritual will be filing papers in the courthouse
2014-10-01T02:29:28  <cosmo> and we'll live in a second/third hand trailer happily ever after
2014-10-01T02:30:08  <vinje> don't forget the crack pipes and scabies
2014-10-01T02:30:19  <vinje> that will really finish off that scene
2014-10-01T02:30:26  <cosmo> hopefully they'll come with the trailer
2014-10-01T02:30:31  <vinje> lol
2014-10-01T02:30:40  <kenel> lol
2014-10-01T02:30:52  <kenel> as much as my wife was anti-establishment when we first met...
2014-10-01T02:31:04  <kenel> we became typical suburbanites after we had kids
2014-10-01T02:31:11  <kenel> kids change your perspective on life man
2014-10-01T02:31:22  <cosmo> that's what happens
2014-10-01T02:31:29  <cosmo> turns out the establishment pays pretty decent
2014-10-01T02:31:37  <cosmo> and decent shelter costs money
2014-10-01T02:31:48  <cosmo> join the club or get fucked
2014-10-01T02:32:03  <kenel> yeah, it's a rat race unless you don't let yourself become part of it
2014-10-01T02:32:05  <vinje> yep
2014-10-01T02:32:20  <vinje> I beecame part of it.  Easiest way to feed the kids.
2014-10-01T02:32:32  <kenel> i run my own company with my mom and uncle
2014-10-01T02:32:35  <vinje> I could proabably make a lot more working w/ rawdawg, but it's not a risk I can take.
2014-10-01T02:32:36  <cosmo> so was it worth the sex
2014-10-01T02:32:43  <kenel> as much as i am a part of it, i don't have to suck up to anyone
2014-10-01T02:32:45  <vinje> cause the little shits eat a ton
2014-10-01T02:32:49  <kenel> in fact i had a huge family blow up this weekend
2014-10-01T02:32:57  <kenel> and cosmo....you have no idea man
2014-10-01T02:33:14  <kenel> i can honestly say i'm not in the dead bedroom club :)
2014-10-01T02:33:29  <cosmo> nice
2014-10-01T02:33:40  <cosmo> i've seen my parents hug once
2014-10-01T02:33:47  <kenel> i'm on my way to losing the 40lbs i gained since we got married
2014-10-01T02:34:11  <kenel> my wife, as an incentive, told me we can buy XXXX$ worth of 'toys' once i hit that goal
2014-10-01T02:34:21  <kenel> my wife is awesome ;\
2014-10-01T02:34:29  <cosmo> man all ya need is some ice
2014-10-01T02:34:43  <kenel> for the record, i'm not fat fat, i just started drinking too much beer
2014-10-01T02:34:55  <kenel> beer belly isn't what it's cracked up to be
2014-10-01T02:35:04  <cosmo> haha
2014-10-01T02:35:11  <cosmo> my old alchy roommate was getting one
2014-10-01T02:35:19  <cosmo> he was 20
2014-10-01T02:35:31  <kenel> i'm more husky than anything; you've seen pictures of me
2014-10-01T02:35:44  <kenel> but i want to get to 190 because i like having some weight behind my punches :P
2014-10-01T02:35:47  <cosmo> i'll believe it
2014-10-01T02:36:01  <cosmo> hell i wish i had 40 more pounds
2014-10-01T02:36:11  <kenel> i'm at 225 now
2014-10-01T02:36:22  <kenel> was at 230 at my fatest; it sucked
2014-10-01T02:36:42  <kenel> today is an exception; i feel sorry for myself, so i'm drinking beer again tonight
2014-10-01T02:36:44  <cosmo> go cold turkey on the beer
2014-10-01T02:36:49  <cosmo> lol
2014-10-01T02:36:51  <cosmo> it'll never end
2014-10-01T02:36:54  <kenel> i didn't have beer for 2 weeks
2014-10-01T02:36:59  <kenel> nah, some bad family shit happened man
2014-10-01T02:37:07  <cosmo> i haven't had weed for a couple months
2014-10-01T02:37:28  <kenel> if i switch to canadian club / diet coke for a month, i lose 10 lbs without doing anything
2014-10-01T02:37:29  <cosmo> i drank a beer a few days ago, before that a few months... sobriety rocks
2014-10-01T02:37:36  <kenel> but right now...
2014-10-01T02:37:45  <kenel> i'm walking 4 miles/day (except today) while playing video games
2014-10-01T02:37:58  <cosmo> on a ds?
2014-10-01T02:38:03  <kenel> nah, ps4
2014-10-01T02:38:10  <cosmo> oh duh, treadmill
2014-10-01T02:38:11  <kenel> i have a treadmill in front of my tv in my garage
2014-10-01T02:39:32  <kenel> i have a sit down with my family tomorrow, so i should be fine after tomorrow
2014-10-01T02:39:39  <kenel> but today...sulking
2014-10-01T02:39:47  <kenel> so, time for some beer and vidya
2014-10-01T02:40:31  <cosmo> i kinda wanna ask what happened but i don't want the responsibility of offering emotional support
2014-10-01T02:40:48  <vinje> lmao
2014-10-01T02:41:00  <kenel> i don't need emotional support
2014-10-01T02:41:04  <vinje> I'm going to use that line next time the wife is weepy
2014-10-01T02:41:13  <kenel> i kicked my mom and dad out of my house at my block party
2014-10-01T02:41:21  <kenel> i almost got into a fist fight with my dad
2014-10-01T02:41:43  <cosmo> good fuck em
2014-10-01T02:41:56  <cosmo> i can't even fight with my dad
2014-10-01T02:42:10  <vinje> yeah mine is like 70 and could still backhand me dead
2014-10-01T02:42:24  <vinje> his forearms are as big as my legs
2014-10-01T02:42:26  <cosmo> mines 76
2014-10-01T02:42:37  <cosmo> only option i got is running
2014-10-01T02:42:42  <vinje> ^
2014-10-01T02:42:51  <vinje> but i'm too stubborn and stupid to run
2014-10-01T02:43:01  <vinje> So I settle for being respectful :)
2014-10-01T02:43:21  <cosmo> yeah
2014-10-01T02:43:46  <cosmo> i'm not really angry at my dad anymore, but like.. i got nothing for him
2014-10-01T02:43:56  <cosmo> he's chill though.
2014-10-01T02:44:13  <vinje> It's not usually a problem.  The only time I've ever seen him lose his shit was when some logger wanted to fight me when I a 15yr old hoodlum
2014-10-01T02:44:31  <vinje> he palmed the guy over the bar :)
2014-10-01T02:44:59  <vinje> That and after hitting his 4th deer in a month lol
2014-10-01T02:45:08  <vinje> he broke it's neck rather than shoot it
2014-10-01T02:45:21  <cosmo> damn
2014-10-01T02:45:40  <vinje> respectful is my only option lol
2014-10-01T02:46:07  <cosmo> yeah it all evens out in a weird way
2014-10-01T02:46:44  <cosmo> does your dad have any stake in the company kenel?
2014-10-01T02:48:39  <vinje> Pretty sure mom is the boss.
2014-10-01T02:50:03  <cosmo> probably easier then
2014-10-01T02:57:01  <kenel> and no
2014-10-01T02:57:02  <kenel> he doesn't

2014-10-01T14:11:39  <ahmed_> going to setup my pool frontend on the DGC testnet today
2014-10-01T14:13:51  <techbytes__> ahmed_ i have three frontends up.  I can put them on the test network

2014-10-01T14:14:29  <kenel-work> so i'm instead going to go back to figuring out how to attract a mechanic to apply to my company because ours is leaving
2014-10-01T14:15:58  <techbytes__> ahmed_ do i just recompile dgcv3 and put it on the testnet?  as in testnet=1?
2014-10-01T14:17:41  <ahmed_> delete all the old dgc appdata
2014-10-01T14:17:49  <ahmed_> and start fresh with testnet = 1 yep

2014-10-01T14:19:00  <RunningmanZ> BCX trolling the DGC thread again. So easy for him to start if you mention Baritus. I think we probably need to not mention Baritus anymore
2014-10-01T14:19:18  <kenel-work> why not?
2014-10-01T14:19:43  <kenel-work> let him talk about the way things used to be so we can talk about how they are now/better :)
2014-10-01T14:19:45  <RunningmanZ> Because it invites BCX to start hijacking our thread and filling it with shit
2014-10-01T14:19:46  <RunningmanZ> :/

2014-10-01T14:21:05  <RunningmanZ> I don't even bother replying to him anymore. Just post positive stuff about DGC now
2014-10-01T14:21:18  <kenel-work> is he saying anything bad about dgc or you?
2014-10-01T14:21:31  <kenel-work> also he never replies to my replies

2014-10-02T15:57:57  <cosmo> i hit a nerve on bcx :)
2014-10-02T16:03:37  <RunningmanZ> typical bcx dick waving response
2014-10-02T16:04:16  <RunningmanZ> i don't even bother responding to him anymore. He has threatened and/or attempted to attack numerous times over
2014-10-02T16:10:46  <cosmo> pretty much
2014-10-02T16:11:18  <cosmo> he's obviously monitoring the thread, not responding with any substance just threats. kinda think i was right in my guess that he's a fud puppet now.
2014-10-02T16:27:55  <RunningmanZ> yeah tbh I think he is just an extortionist who has over the years pulled the wool over everyones eyes with his penis waving and threats. Just a total scumbag and waste of space tbh
2014-10-02T16:30:42  <RunningmanZ> problem is he is a master troll with nothing better to do so will just keep replying endlessly.
2014-10-02T16:31:03  <RunningmanZ> he is also a*
2014-10-02T16:32:08  <RunningmanZ> i would not at all be surprised if he looked somewhat like this -> http://calculatedbravery.files.wordpress.com/2014/01/nerd-46422.jpg

2014-10-02T16:34:36  <cosmo> lol probably
2014-10-02T16:36:12  <RunningmanZ> Its interesting he is trolling hard again now when the DGC price seems to be levelling out again. Probably trying to FUD it down so he can PnD again, just like he probably does with other coins. CHeck his post history and you will see how he attacks other coins in a similar manner to how he has attacked us with the same threats
2014-10-02T16:38:40  <cosmo> yeah, that's what i called him out on
2014-10-02T16:38:49  <cosmo> i'm coining the term now, FUD puppet
2014-10-02T16:41:21  <RunningmanZ> Yeah, the thing is he seems to not give a shit what anyone says about him and will just argue endlessly. You can't win because his dick is up the mods' asses as well on Bitcointalk. Its very frustrating, but thats how it is with some people. They are just moronic, gutless cowards who hide behind a keyboard and delight in causing misery and chaos.
2014-10-02T16:43:53  <RunningmanZ> I'm not sure its worth starting up another war with him. DO we really want his shit polluting the DGC threads again? As much as I enjoy replying to that dickhead sometimes in the end it gets you nowhere I think
2014-10-02T16:47:06  <RunningmanZ> he threatened to attack litecoin way back in 2012
2014-10-02T16:47:18  <RunningmanZ> reckon he bought a shitload of ltc then too probably

2014-10-02T17:17:30  <RunningmanZ> There was some big story about some Danny Maddox guy that got harassed and the FBI were called into it etc
2014-10-02T17:17:50  <RunningmanZ> ppl saying it was BCX just making up a bullshit story to get the heat off himself
2014-10-02T17:18:52  <RunningmanZ> im pretty sure he gets pissed off tho when referred as Danny Maddox. Seem to remmeber an old post where he got angry about it a year or so ago
2014-10-02T17:21:38  <RunningmanZ> See that 3rd post down in that thread. BCX seems to be apologising

2014-10-03T02:28:36  <samson_> Someone appears to have a bot maintaining the price around the 0.00003 level - why not remove it and allow the price to find its natural level until the V3 release

2014-10-03T11:54:38  <RunningmanZ> but its getting alot quicker now tho I would expect maybe 6-8 weeks instead now
2014-10-03T11:55:47  <RunningmanZ> Got RiftMax working. I started my own server and was playing 'Serenity' to test it out. So cool.

2014-10-03T16:46:29  <techbytes> he said he was the one on DGC last night on DGC when nethash hit 12GH
2014-10-03T16:46:52  <CoHe> Could be true though
2014-10-03T16:47:25  <techbytes> "Yep that was me.

2014-10-03T16:48:04  <CoHe> Well if we bow for a threat like that...its ridiculous he mentions such a thing even
2014-10-03T16:48:22  <CoHe> Its funny though this beef with DGC
2014-10-03T16:48:42  <CoHe> Either he fears it or him and Baritus went to the same school and he was beaten up daily
2014-10-03T16:49:21  <techbytes> we are not going to renounce baritus... i already stated that baritus is no longer involve with the development with DGC...
2014-10-03T16:50:29  <CoHe> I never read his posts.Way to much negativity in this world as is.
2014-10-03T17:00:42  <samson_> Just ignore the prick, I'd rather not have somone like BCX involved with 'securing' DGC. In my opinion he's not welcome, he can go fuck himself
2014-10-03T17:01:00  <CoHe> lolz aggreed
2014-10-03T17:04:24  <cosmo> how much hashpower is the foundation combined?

2014-10-03T21:40:12  <cosmo> he won't get off our backs tech
2014-10-03T21:40:17  <cosmo> any thread we make he'll fill it with fud
2014-10-03T21:40:43  <cosmo> all he's saying is 'agree with me or i'll break your stuff'
2014-10-03T21:44:08  <techbytes> if you ignore him then he has nothing to go on other than bashing baritus
2014-10-03T21:44:37  <samson_> This is true, eventually he will get tired of this as Baritus is no longer here.
2014-10-03T21:45:25  <techbytes> if you are posting about the missing dgc and baritus, you will only inviting more fud
2014-10-03T21:45:56  <samson_> Baritus has gone
2014-10-03T21:46:27  <samson_> If he continues to talk about Baritus constantly then he will look like a prick
2014-10-03T21:46:54  <samson_> He is a prick but that's besides the point
2014-10-03T21:48:10  <samson_> Multi algorithms will protect against attackers won't they ?
2014-10-03T21:48:36  <cosmo> depends how much hash we get through it
2014-10-03T21:48:37  <samson_> I suspect it will be much harder for him to cause problems with 3 separate algorithms on the go
2014-10-03T21:49:05  <cosmo> yeah, it's still doable though, if he's rich as some people are saying he could fork the chain in a day regardless
2014-10-03T21:49:05  <samson_> An adversary would need to attack on three different fronts
2014-10-03T21:49:27  <cosmo> Just rent out enough hash for each algo and you can do what you want.
2014-10-03T21:49:37  <samson_> And then what ? Baritus says nothing and nothing changes
2014-10-03T21:49:51  <samson_> Apart from maybe I'll pick up a million DGC very cheaply before we move on
2014-10-03T21:50:04  <cosmo> well if bcx breaks the chain all our coins are worthless
2014-10-03T21:50:10  <samson_> No they're not
2014-10-03T21:50:19  <cosmo> we could roll back?
2014-10-03T21:50:28  <samson_> You can't just break it - action can be taken
2014-10-03T21:50:57  <samson_> In recent bitcoin releases there's all sorts of stuff there for rolling back blocks
2014-10-03T21:51:17  <cosmo> really
2014-10-03T21:51:23  <samson_> Even if we needed to do a hard fork reset we could do so, there's no way to just break it permanently
2014-10-03T21:51:37  <cosmo> i should stop using that word then
2014-10-03T21:51:56  <cosmo> hell maybe the chain being forked would force people to tune into what's happening
2014-10-03T21:52:48  <cosmo> i dunno i just don't see how DGC will get enough solo hashpower through merged mining.. we'll have to do lots of PR, and BCX will be there to fuck up every thread.
2014-10-03T21:53:13  <samson_> Fuck BCX, ignore him
2014-10-03T21:53:48  <samson_> If we have issues down the road then we could always do the merged mining but that's for another day
2014-10-03T21:53:51  <cosmo> aghh
2014-10-03T21:54:06  <cosmo> yeah, you're right
2014-10-03T21:54:25  <samson_> I suspect he realises that once DGC3 is out things get much harder for him to cause any problems - this is why he's come back now - it's his last chance
2014-10-03T21:55:33  <cosmo> you think he'll actually attack the network?
2014-10-03T21:55:45  <cosmo> with that 11gh/s of power that supposedly his
2014-10-03T21:56:00  <samson_> I don't know what he will or won't do
2014-10-03T21:56:18  <cosmo> if he does fuck it we'll roll back to before the fork on v3?
2014-10-03T21:56:50  <samson_> There are checkpoint blocks right
2014-10-03T21:57:03  <samson_> most of the blocks are empty
2014-10-03T21:57:43  <samson_> The danger is that he could complete a successful double spend against an exchange but that would be a criminal matter for the exchange to deal with
2014-10-03T21:58:37  <samson_> Ahmed will know a lot more about this than me
2014-10-03T22:00:01  <cosmo> alright

2014-10-03T22:30:21  <cosmo> not kill the fundraiser, it's a good idea. i think it'd work better if we timed it with a testnet release.
2014-10-03T22:30:40  <cosmo> and sorry i should've just ignored bcx.
2014-10-03T22:32:04  <techbytes> if bcx decides to back off and then out of the blue we get a post from baritus taunting bcx then that theory about bcx = baritus is plausible.
2014-10-03T22:32:26  <techbytes> we shall see...
2014-10-03T22:33:12  <cosmo> what
2014-10-03T22:33:17  <cosmo> i don't see it
2014-10-03T22:34:42  <cosmo> eh whatever.. guess all i can say is good luck devs
2014-10-03T22:39:57  <ahmed_> cosmo chill out dude
2014-10-03T22:40:16  <ahmed_> BCX likely does have the ability to fork DGC in its current state
2014-10-03T22:40:25  <ahmed_> but the likelihood of him forking the V3 Chain is minimal
2014-10-03T22:40:50  <ahmed_> AND he cant revert any of the previous blocks when V3 kicks in due to hardcoded checkpoints
2014-10-03T22:41:20  <ahmed_> ALSO 1 other thing. i need hashrate for all 3 algorithm's
2014-10-03T22:41:27  <ahmed_> going to setup a testnet pool now
2014-10-03T22:41:52  <cosmo> yeah he's getting under my skin
2014-10-03T22:42:11  <cosmo> i'm arguing points that prove him wrong and he's ignoring them

2014-10-03T23:54:19  <cosmo> yeah techbytes, if you won't bend to BCX's will he'll continue to troll us
2014-10-03T23:54:37  <cosmo> could make self-moderated threads and just delete everything he says

2014-10-04T02:17:05  <samson_> When we have the meeting this Sunday we should talk about self moderated official threads
2014-10-04T02:17:23  <RunningmanZ> did u rad that old BCX thrad i posted last night?
2014-10-04T02:17:26  <RunningmanZ> read*
2014-10-04T02:17:29  <RunningmanZ> thread*
2014-10-04T02:17:33  <RunningmanZ> ack my typing.
2014-10-04T02:17:44  <samson_> yeah, I've been reading them all
2014-10-04T02:17:45  <RunningmanZ> He got his ass handed to him in that thread.
2014-10-04T02:17:50  <RunningmanZ> lol
2014-10-04T02:17:54  <RunningmanZ> Danny Maddox hehehe
2014-10-04T02:17:59  <samson_> I've seen some of them before too a long time ago
2014-10-04T02:18:20  <RunningmanZ> yeah even the mod Theymos said he was using a bct account called Danny Maddox
2014-10-04T02:18:22  <RunningmanZ> what a dick
2014-10-04T02:18:44  <samson_> This looks cool : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtLEYSoYdkc
2014-10-04T02:18:59  <samson_> Oculus Rift DK2 - DCS F-15C - First Impressions (60fps)
2014-10-04T02:19:51  <RunningmanZ> fk ya im debating on downloading that or WarThunder next. But they are around 8GB d/l or so. Apparently its amazing too
2014-10-04T02:20:47  <RunningmanZ> I was in a movie theatre last night with some ppl. You can join ppls movies theatres and watch whatever they are streaming.
2014-10-04T02:20:48  <RunningmanZ> :D
2014-10-04T02:21:51  <RunningmanZ> live for speed is amazing too on the Rift http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeKjVWIbwzE
2014-10-04T02:22:05  <samson_> A helicopter gunship game would be pretty cool - slower and more control
2014-10-04T02:22:12  <cosmo> let's not delete those threads, just lock them, BCX is making an idiot out of himself
2014-10-04T02:22:41  <cosmo> uugh i shouldn't get off on defaming him like this
2014-10-04T02:22:54  <samson_> yes, I suggest new threads should be self moderated then we can delete the idiots comments as they appear
2014-10-04T02:23:16  <cosmo> yyyyup
2014-10-04T02:23:35  <cosmo> i'd like to reference to the old threads as an explanation why the new ones are moderated but ya know..
2014-10-04T02:23:51  <samson_> sure, we can talk about this in the meeting anyway
2014-10-04T02:23:59  <cosmo> maybe if the question pops up. should take a screenshot of them too in case bcx tries to edit his posts
2014-10-04T02:24:41  <RunningmanZ> as much as I'd l;ove to post that thread to BCX where he got a beatdown, it might just set him off even worse on us lol
2014-10-04T02:24:55  <samson_> yes, hold off on that one
2014-10-04T02:25:09  <samson_> we want rid of him
2014-10-04T02:26:12  <RunningmanZ> yeah ive been very good lately at biting my tongue with him. You can't win as he is a nutjob
2014-10-04T02:28:09  <samson_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDd9_tAHtXY
2014-10-04T02:28:18  <samson_> DCS Huey on the Oculus Rift DK2 / Max Flight Stick - Collective
2014-10-04T02:31:32  <cosmo> yeah, if you make a good argument against him he just ignores it. we're gonna have to self-mod to avoid him.
2014-10-04T02:31:43  <samson_> +1
2014-10-04T02:33:08  <samson_> I need information on someone who I can hire to make me a coin that I will use for my own testing purposes only (programming)
2014-10-04T02:33:24  <samson_> But I also want a full windows client build environment so I can make tweaks
2014-10-04T02:33:31  <samson_> This will serve a dual purpose
2014-10-04T02:34:00  <samson_> It will give us a proven build environment for windows wallet building which we can also use for the DGC wallet
2014-10-04T02:34:11  <samson_> There are some issues with building the windows wallet
2014-10-04T02:34:25  <samson_> They appear to be related to the mining part of the wallet
2014-10-04T02:34:43  <samson_> Do we need the mining part of the DGC wallet any more - I'd like to suggest that it can be removed
2014-10-04T02:35:34  <samson_> The issues are with scrypt-sse2.cpp which I believe is optimised Scrypt hashing based on differing CPU's
2014-10-04T02:36:03  <samson_> I don't think anyone is every going to mine from a windows qt wallet and it's something that was removed from Bitcoin-Qt already
2014-10-04T02:36:20  <samson_> That's something else to maybe talk about in this Sundays meeting
2014-10-04T02:36:39  <samson_> I will also be online for the meeting this Sunday
2014-10-04T02:36:55  <cosmo> for miners only :p i have no idea.
2014-10-04T02:37:09  <RunningmanZ> samson_:I just started downloading DCS world ;)
2014-10-04T02:37:28  <cosmo> could always ask baritus
2014-10-04T02:37:33  <samson_> Me neither on mining - but I know nobody uses it - if we remove it the build problem goes away from what I understand and we get a windows wallet !
2014-10-04T02:37:42  <samson_> Forget about Baritus for now
2014-10-04T02:39:15  <samson_> ahmed_: The scrypt-sse2.cpp issue on windows build (it won't compile) - I believe this is only used in mining - am I correct on this ? Also am I correct that this part of the qt-wallet is no longer required, needed or in fact used by anyone as mining is not done in the qt client any more ?
2014-10-04T02:39:30  <cosmo> i like baritus
2014-10-04T02:39:52  <samson_> Sure
2014-10-04T02:39:54  <cosmo> but yeah i get it, word slips we work with him all hell breaks loose
2014-10-04T02:40:08  <samson_> It would be better if we managed to do this on our own though
2014-10-04T02:40:15  <RunningmanZ> I wonder if his CAve new project will ever see the light of day
2014-10-04T02:40:27  <RunningmanZ> I've almost written it off for now. Anyone heard from him about it?
2014-10-04T02:40:31  <samson_> I hope so as I own 10% of it but who knows
2014-10-04T02:40:33  <cosmo> but he's there, ya know? i don't want to ignore him just for public appearences.
2014-10-04T02:41:00  <samson_> He said he was writing code so it's a wait and see job to see what he comes up with
2014-10-04T02:41:20  <RunningmanZ> I'm almosty starting to wish I sold all my CAV when it was like 200 CAV a share
2014-10-04T02:41:20  <samson_> I mesaged him recently but heard nothing back from him
2014-10-04T02:41:36  <cosmo> ah well
2014-10-04T02:41:36  <RunningmanZ> but maybe he will come up with something worthwhile
2014-10-04T02:41:44  <RunningmanZ> can't do much about it now
2014-10-04T02:41:57  <RunningmanZ> er 20 DGC per share*
2014-10-04T02:42:00  <RunningmanZ> 200*
2014-10-04T02:42:03  <RunningmanZ> fkin typos lol
2014-10-04T02:42:13  <cosmo> if anyone contacts him it's purely on a non-business, friendly level that the rest of us don't need to hear about.
2014-10-04T02:43:01  <RunningmanZ> yeah best to not mention it in case it gets back to BCX. I dunno what his beef is with Baritus. He is obsessed
2014-10-04T02:43:50  <samson_> exactly
2014-10-04T02:44:25  <samson_> A sa 10% shareholder in CAVE I will never stop talking to Baritus and I don't care who knows it
2014-10-04T02:45:01  <cosmo> i don't care :D
2014-10-04T02:47:16  <samson_> time for sleep, later
2014-10-04T02:50:59  <cosmo> see ya
2014-10-04T03:00:40  <RunningmanZ> samson_:cya
2014-10-04T03:07:00  <RunningmanZ> I think Scrappy has cracked the sads with me because I haven't sent him any donations for his betting yet
2014-10-04T03:16:31  <RunningmanZ> meh im booting him if he doesn't answer. slack prick
2014-10-04T03:16:32  <RunningmanZ> lol

2014-10-04T14:12:11  <RunningmanZ> I'm thinking just try and figure out how to get it to compile? If you go fiddling around removing stuff it might have some unexpected problems later on? Is there any other people that have done this that we could talk to?
2014-10-04T14:14:26  <RunningmanZ> As for the self moderation I think it could be a good idea. I'm just wondering tho if the trolls will just start other threads saying we are biased/corrupt etc because we delete stuff we don't want to hear? I guess you have to weight up the lesser of two evills?
2014-10-04T14:14:26  <RunningmanZ> evil*
2014-10-04T14:14:26  <RunningmanZ> I guess we could still self moderate just the really annoying blatant troll stuff and leave the fair arguments in the threads
2014-10-04T14:15:16  <samson_> Mining has been removed from the Bitcoin QT Client
2014-10-04T14:15:23  <samson_> Why is it still in DGC ?
2014-10-04T14:15:28  <samson_> This is causing the problem
2014-10-04T14:17:45  <techbytes> samson, if you need to make your own coin, try this:  http://coinry.com/

2014-10-04T14:17:55  <samson_> I haven't looked at the source in any detail but it's possible that the CPU optimised scrypt routines are also called from other places within the program - this is not needed any more, from my knowledge the only time a QT client needs to create a scrypt hash will when verifying incoming blocks
2014-10-04T14:19:12  <samson_> Thanks for the link Techbytes, I'm going to email them - I'd like a currency of my own to play around with so I can make changes to the client source codes and see how they work out
2014-10-04T14:19:51  <techbytes> yes that would be your best bet at testing
2014-10-04T14:20:35  <samson_> Yes, I think so - I'm going to email them asking if they can also make me a vmware build environment so I can compile windows wallets for my test coin as well
2014-10-04T14:21:30  <samson_> hmm, can't find any way to contact them
2014-10-04T14:24:17  <samson_> They charge $50 a month as well, not a one off fee
2014-10-04T14:24:26  <samson_> well $49

2014-10-04T21:46:56  <samson_> ahmed_: are you there ?
2014-10-04T21:48:35  <samson_> Has anyone done any work into slowing down hashing functions to the point of real slowness by adding additional steps ?
2014-10-04T21:51:09  <samson_> Specifically I'm talking about using the result of a hash function for a block as an ECDSA private key, generating a public keypair from this private key, hashing that and using that for the result - this will introduce a massive orders of magnitide increase in difficulty to solving a block - Proof of Work would no longer be simple hash results but something much more complex.
2014-10-04T21:52:09  <samson_> I'm not sure if anyone's ever suggested expanding proof of work from simple hashing before - any thoughts or ideas on this kind of thing ?
2014-10-04T21:53:29  <samson_> There are many primitives which could be introduced - point multiplication is something that is slow and takes time to perform
2014-10-04T21:53:49  <samson_> I hope you read this and let me know what you think...
2014-10-04T22:00:55  <kenel> i don't know when ahmed is leaving for vegas
2014-10-04T22:04:56  <samson_> BCX will not leave us alone - we should make DGC much much harder to attack by introducing something new.
2014-10-04T22:05:22  <samson_> I told him to go fuck himself - he's not listening to reason. He is an enemy not of Baritus but of DGC
2014-10-04T22:06:13  <samson_> We should take steps prior to DGC3 to limit this even if it means something completely new - taking proof of work to the next level.

2014-10-04T22:56:52  <samson_> I'm making a forum post with details I got from #bitcoin-wizards but I'll copy it here anyway :
2014-10-04T22:57:22  <ahmed_> 1 small change and we cant use the software on any other coin which means all NOMP based DGC pools will likely close unless they're willing to put work in
2014-10-04T22:58:27  <samson_> How about if it was used for just one of the multi algorithms in DGX3 - a fourth algorithm ?
2014-10-04T22:58:32  <samson_> *DGC3
2014-10-04T22:58:42  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:34] <samson_> With proof of work requiring a base primitive in the form of an sha256 digest, does anyone think that this could be expanded on to make the problem exponentially harder by adding additional steps ?
2014-10-04T22:58:42  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:35] <justanotheruser> samson_: it has been made harder in altcoinns. Why do you think this is desirable though?
2014-10-04T22:58:42  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:35] <HM> it already is made harder by requiring a 0 prefix
2014-10-04T22:58:43  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:35] <[nsh]> btw, bit of light entertainment (hopefully): https://www.reddit.com/r/crypto/comments/2i9qke/openssl_bug_allows_rsa_1024_key_factorization_in/
2014-10-04T22:58:43  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:35] <samson_> I'm talking about each iteration - all we use are basic hashes
2014-10-04T22:58:43  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:36] <samson_> For example an sha256 digest which is then used as an ECDSA private key, pubkey is created by doing point addition - this is then ran through sha256 to get the final hash which requires the zeroes = hugely harder and much more complex
2014-10-04T22:58:43  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:37] <justanotheruser> samson_: why would you want the additional complexity?
2014-10-04T22:58:44  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:38] <andytoshi> sounds he is trying to violate every part of asic-faq.pdf at once..
2014-10-04T22:58:44  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:38] <samson_> To slow down the miners and reduce difficulty - I'm thinking of alt security here - legacy hardware would be useless to attack them
2014-10-04T22:58:45  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:38] <justanotheruser> samson_: you can do H1(H2(...H13(block header)...)), and it has been done, but it isn't desirable
2014-10-04T22:58:45  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:39] <samson_> This would be highly experimental and not for Bitcoin itself but more as a test on an alt
2014-10-04T22:58:46  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:39] * HaltingState (~HaltingSt@unaffiliated/haltingstate) Quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2014-10-04T22:58:46  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:39] <justanotheruser> samson_: slowing down miners by a factor of 10 just means someone who could own 10% of the network hashrate with their cluster at 10mh/s can now own 10% of the network at 1mh/s with their entire cluster
2014-10-04T22:58:47  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:40] <justanotheruser> however, nodes now require 10x the CPU power to verify a block
2014-10-04T22:58:47  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:40] <xmj> fluffypony: how's that freebsd port of monero coming along?
2014-10-04T22:58:48  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:41] <Luke-Jr> samson_: for a PoW, you want the verify to be as easy/cheap/fast as possible; adding more steps slows that down
2014-10-04T22:58:48  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:41] <Luke-Jr> samson_: in other words, making it harder is the opposite of what is desirable
2014-10-04T22:58:49  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:42] <Luke-Jr> xmj: this is not #monero
2014-10-04T22:58:49  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:42] <justanotheruser> samson_: useful reading https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/asic-faq.pdf
2014-10-04T22:58:50  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:42] <samson_> Luke-Jr: Sure, there would be more overhead in verifying buy that's nothing compared to mining there it's only donw once
2014-10-04T22:58:50  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:43] <samson_> Thanks for that link - I will have a good read through it
2014-10-04T22:58:51  <samson_> [05/10/2014 04:43] <Luke-Jr> samson_: you gain nothing from making each iteration harder
2014-10-04T22:59:45  <samson_> The verify would still be pretty quick, just one ECDSA operation - but for mining it will need a lot
2014-10-04T22:59:54  <samson_> I'll dump this on the forum anyway
2014-10-04T23:00:03  <ahmed_> samson_:  the iteration is harder for everyone though
2014-10-04T23:00:11  <ahmed_> so there's no security increase
2014-10-04T23:00:34  <samson_> yes, I know but legacy asics 100% cant be used for this
2014-10-04T23:00:52  <samson_> difficulty would be much ower on a POW like this right ?
2014-10-04T23:00:55  <ahmed_> Your also forgetting the fact that A) BCX/ArtForz knows what he's doing and can have a gpu based miner made easily, B) that he has a huge GPU/CPU farm
2014-10-04T23:01:29  <ahmed_> theres only 2 types of asics, sha and scrypt. those asics may still be able to be used. it depends on how its done
2014-10-04T23:01:41  <ahmed_> e.g. with mediterraneancoin it uses dual sha and scrypt
2014-10-04T23:02:01  <ahmed_> so the ASIC does the sha part while CPU does the scrypt part
2014-10-04T23:02:12  <samson_> The ECDSA privkey calculation is the slow but - it's not that slow so for verification it's fast - it would only be slow for mining
2014-10-04T23:02:46  <samson_> It's point multiplication which makes it slow - not the hashing - the hashing becomes almost irrelevant
2014-10-04T23:03:20  <samson_> Sorry - ECDSA privkey -> pubkey - then hashed pubkey to get the hash with the zeroes would slow it down
2014-10-04T23:03:51  <samson_> So it becomes about doing ecdsa fast - does anyone do this ?
2014-10-04T23:04:39  <ahmed_> no idea but i dont believe in it im afraid
2014-10-04T23:04:52  <ahmed_> there's nothing stopping someone from offloading that work to the CPU
2014-10-04T23:05:18  <samson_> Sure, I would rely on it
2014-10-04T23:05:37  <samson_> hence slowness
2014-10-04T23:05:53  <ahmed_> doesnt make it any slower if it can be done in parallel
2014-10-04T23:05:55  <ahmed_> thats my point
2014-10-04T23:07:41  <samson_> So yo uthink X11 woudld provide more protection than this ?
2014-10-04T23:08:02  <samson_> He said our Xll changes will be trivial to beat and we are going to be in for a surprise
2014-10-04T23:08:13  <ahmed_> samson_: I DO
2014-10-04T23:08:54  <samson_> I guess the question comes down to how much time, money and effort is he willing to go spend to attack
2014-10-04T23:22:52  <ahmed_> yep
2014-10-04T23:23:23  <ahmed_> and my thinking is not much. even if he does he's going to have to get past a) the X blocks in a row limit's, and b) the multi-algo stuff
2014-10-04T23:24:41  <samson_> The X blocks in a row is in V3 ?
2014-10-04T23:25:06  <ahmed_> it will be
2014-10-04T23:25:22  <ahmed_> something im going to port over from myriadcoin

2014-10-04T23:26:30  <samson_> If The DGC Foundation will at least openly admit the whole Baritus theft episode is suspect, I will leave DGC alone and drop this.
2014-10-04T23:26:30  <samson_> I have nothing against DGC.
2014-10-04T23:26:30  <samson_> If you're thinking that X11 or merged mining will save you I can hardly wait for reality to hit.
2014-10-04T23:27:07  <samson_> So he is already preparing an artack by the looks of it
2014-10-04T23:27:21  <ahmed_> samson_: thats just FUD
2014-10-04T23:27:27  <ahmed_> merged-mining will help DGC
2014-10-04T23:27:39  <samson_> We're not going merged ming though are we ?
2014-10-04T23:27:43  <samson_> *mining
2014-10-04T23:27:48  <ahmed_> because for a timewarp/51% you need a good percentage of all blocks and a good percentage of nethash
2014-10-04T23:27:57  <ahmed_> samson_: i know we're not but im just pointing it out
2014-10-04T23:28:03  <ahmed_> he's bullshitting
2014-10-04T23:28:40  <samson_> ok, I did wonder about that as there would be pools doing the merged mining which he surely couldn't compete with
2014-10-04T23:29:16  <samson_> I told him to go fuck himself anyway
2014-10-04T23:29:21  <ahmed_> yup
2014-10-04T23:29:28  <ahmed_> anyways i gotta get back to coding now
2014-10-04T23:29:40  <ahmed_> firing up the pool to see how it goes
2014-10-04T23:29:44  <samson_> ok, if there's a meeting are you in on it tomorrow ?
2014-10-04T23:29:55  <ahmed_> sure
2014-10-04T23:30:05  <samson_> ok, me too - later !
2014-10-04T23:30:20  <ahmed_> incase any of u guys wanna help me test pool is here: http://212.159.185.14/user/dashboard
2014-10-04T23:30:48  <ahmed_> dgc scrypt works fine mined > 200 blocks on it
2014-10-04T23:30:50  <samson_> One more question Ahmed - does anyone ever use QT client mining any more ?
2014-10-04T23:31:03  <ahmed_> not really
2014-10-04T23:31:07  <ahmed_> only noobs really
2014-10-04T23:31:10  <samson_> I see this has gone from Bitcoin-QT
2014-10-04T23:31:37  <samson_> If we remove it from DGC I suspect the windows build issues will disappear

2014-10-04T23:33:13  <ahmed_> samson_: we have to keep it
2014-10-04T23:33:19  <ahmed_> but we can remove things like sse2 compat
2014-10-04T23:33:46  <samson_> ok but it needs building - for some reason that won't compile - hence no windows waller
2014-10-04T23:33:48  <samson_> wallet
2014-10-04T23:33:53  <ahmed_> weird
2014-10-04T23:34:11  <ahmed_> the files are used to verify the blocks or id be all for getting rid of them
2014-10-04T23:34:36  <samson_> ok, I thought maybe scrypt.cpp would be used to verify the blocks
2014-10-04T23:35:03  <samson_> perhaps that then calls this to make it quicker
2014-10-04T23:37:09  <ahmed_> samson_: which file is causing errors?
2014-10-04T23:37:25  <samson_> scrypt-sse2.cpp
2014-10-04T23:37:55  <ahmed_> yeah thats only used on devices where it can be used
2014-10-04T23:38:32  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:19] <xawksow> and it is just scrypt-sse2
2014-10-04T23:38:32  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:19] <xawksow> it is only because of scrypt-sse2.cpp in src
2014-10-04T23:38:33  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:19] <xawksow> that is why i could not compile it at the fist time
2014-10-04T23:38:33  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:19] <samson_> ok, I read about someone else having problems with that somewhere
2014-10-04T23:38:33  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:19] <xawksow> and after switcithing to other toolchains things get worse
2014-10-04T23:38:43  <samson_> Yes this is what I understand
2014-10-04T23:38:57  <samson_> Maybe we could just turn it off
2014-10-04T23:39:11  <samson_> So it reverts to regular scrypt.cpp
2014-10-04T23:39:19  <ahmed_> yep
2014-10-04T23:39:52  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:21] <samson_> I wonder if it's possible that the functions inside it are only called from one place
2014-10-04T23:39:53  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:22] <xawksow> yea probably, and are only called ifdef __SSE2__
2014-10-04T23:39:53  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:22] <xawksow> but we would need to search those refs
2014-10-04T23:39:53  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:22] <xawksow> and kill them al
2014-10-04T23:39:53  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:22] <xawksow> l
2014-10-04T23:39:54  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:22] <xawksow> maybe ahmed can do that when he got time
2014-10-04T23:39:54  <samson_> [02/10/2014 20:22] <xawksow> because i don'T think we really need that
2014-10-04T23:41:06  <samson_> So there will be a windows wallet apparently once this issue is resolved and a permanent build environment ready to use whenever we need it - on a server which we can access whenever we need it
2014-10-04T23:41:37  <samson_> Food for thought for the meeting anyway
2014-10-04T23:42:38  <samson_> I don't mind funding work on this in USD - lets get it done, if we can't do it ourselves maybe someone else can do it
2014-10-04T23:42:50  <samson_> But I don't know who....
2014-10-04T23:43:50  <samson_> also I trust nobody outside this group
2014-10-04T23:47:28  <ahmed_> i could do that
2014-10-04T23:48:03  <samson_> ok, lets get it done - speak to me directly on it if you want.
2014-10-04T23:49:33  <samson_> Once we have this windows build environment up and running perfectly I will try to make a vmware virtual machine out of it so it can be moved around and used wherever it's  needed.
2014-10-04T23:50:07  <samson_> But for now my online windows server can be used by logging into it - it's fast, plenty of memory and seems to work well
2014-10-04T23:50:13  <samson_> ok talk to you guys tomorrow

2014-10-05T01:49:21  <kenel> it wasn't like 'let's invite wolf and tie him down and tickle torture him until he gives us the password'

2014-10-05T01:58:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I have a high threshold for TMI
2014-10-05T01:58:29  <kenel> yeah, i'm the same way
2014-10-05T01:58:37  <cosmo> god bless the internet
2014-10-05T01:59:01  <kenel> not only do i do side work for adult companies....i also used to train myself to watch gory shit because i was going to be a forensic scientist before i realized i'm much better at business
2014-10-05T02:00:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I used to watch gory shit because...
2014-10-05T02:00:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> shit, I don't even know
2014-10-05T02:00:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> anyway, kenel
2014-10-05T02:00:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> know any good adult companies worth buying shit from?
2014-10-05T02:01:10  <kenel> depends on what you're looking for
2014-10-05T02:01:17  <kenel> i work with the vstroker.com guys
2014-10-05T02:01:22  <kenel> our shit is cool :)
2014-10-05T02:01:37  <kenel> we sell a ton of our product to germany for some reason, lol
2014-10-05T02:01:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: You pretty much know what I'm looking for, lol
2014-10-05T02:02:03  <kenel> ah, so for that stuff, i actually don't know
2014-10-05T02:02:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Really? IT'S YOUR JOB TO KNOW :P
2014-10-05T02:02:16  <kenel> the problem with that genre is that it's ripped/spread all over the place
2014-10-05T02:02:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Both genres?
2014-10-05T02:02:37  <kenel> so chances are REALLY high that even if you buy from a site, it's probably ripped from somewhere else
2014-10-05T02:02:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Very true
2014-10-05T02:02:52  <kenel> i don't know the other genre, i just know the fox pussy genre :P
2014-10-05T02:03:08  <cosmo> talking about it likes its literature lol
2014-10-05T02:03:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> However, I am a member of one site - the content is solid. I know, because my very favorit chick works for them
2014-10-05T02:03:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Hell, I think she's staff
2014-10-05T02:03:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Nah, I meant the IRL stff
2014-10-05T02:03:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *stuff
2014-10-05T02:03:41  <kenel> oh
2014-10-05T02:03:51  <kenel> even then, most of that stuff is freely available on tubes and/or torrents
2014-10-05T02:03:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> yeah I know
2014-10-05T02:04:06  <kenel> like, for example, POVD.com has revolutionized POV videos
2014-10-05T02:04:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and most of it is low res/short clips
2014-10-05T02:04:15  <kenel> but....you can get it all in 720HD on torrent sites
2014-10-05T02:04:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but this site - they have a really novel way of making sure they get paid
2014-10-05T02:04:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it works like kickstartr
2014-10-05T02:04:41  <kenel> vstroker.com for example....our videos are coded to actually work with the stroker
2014-10-05T02:04:47  <kenel> fast/slow/etc as you pump it
2014-10-05T02:05:02  <kenel> so you actually HAVE to buy the videos from us because when it loads, it checks to make sure your subscription is active
2014-10-05T02:05:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's filmed, then they release a teaser and images + description. There's a target amount that's set for its release, and a set time it'll be run for
2014-10-05T02:05:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and then people pay in for it until it hits that point, or the end of the run comes - if the end comes without reaching the target, everyone is refunded
2014-10-05T02:06:09  <kenel> what site is that?
2014-10-05T02:06:13  <kenel> i hadn't heard of that one
2014-10-05T02:06:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It's FAR cheaper to buy during runs than when the vids are available
2014-10-05T02:06:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> which gets more people to do the former - meaning we get new shit
2014-10-05T02:06:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Lol, dunno if I should say
2014-10-05T02:07:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I forget if you know or not
2014-10-05T02:07:20  <kenel> you work in the industry too? or if i know what?
2014-10-05T02:07:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: There's pretty much only one thing I don't tell anyone who wants to know about what I like
2014-10-05T02:08:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> meh, idc
2014-10-05T02:08:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> there's a public URL, and a private one for members
2014-10-05T02:08:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they only accept anon payment (BTC among the choices)
2014-10-05T02:09:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Before I post the public teaser site URL
2014-10-05T02:09:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I want to make sure no one is like, "I didn't see the NSFW"
2014-10-05T02:10:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> YOU GET ONE WARNING, SEEING THIS MAY CAUSE TRAUMA

2014-10-05T02:12:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> techbytes: No problem; I tend to make them stronger the more explicit the content - makes the chances of mistakes go down
2014-10-05T02:15:58  <cosmo> do you like to peek at magazines, filled with doggies and leather queens
2014-10-05T02:17:56  <kenel> ah, well that shit's technically illegal in US
2014-10-05T02:18:13  <kenel> so, it doesn't bother me
2014-10-05T02:18:17  <kenel> but i can't really look at it :P
2014-10-05T02:19:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Nope
2014-10-05T02:19:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm in the US
2014-10-05T02:19:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Legal in every US state
2014-10-05T02:19:14  <kenel> no shit? i thought it wasn't
2014-10-05T02:19:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> not in the Virgin Islands, though
2014-10-05T02:19:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Illegal in UK
2014-10-05T02:19:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The act varies by state
2014-10-05T02:19:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> porn is legal everywhere

2014-10-05T02:31:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: You'd probably get a lot of response, too
2014-10-05T02:31:09  <RunningmanZ> a guy at my school came dressed at the yr 12 dance as a giant condom. He got sent home by the teachers. LOL
2014-10-05T02:31:16  <RunningmanZ> was hilarious

2014-10-05T02:31:50  <cosmo> no that's just people in general
2014-10-05T02:32:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Furs more than most.

2014-10-05T02:35:48  <kenel> mspaint is the best
2014-10-05T02:36:06  <cosmo> nice tech
2014-10-05T02:36:12  <techbytes> i dumped half already today...
2014-10-05T02:36:28  <techbytes> locked in that profit.
2014-10-05T02:37:08  <kenel> i was an idiot and bought into kassado's rby
2014-10-05T02:37:16  <kenel> now i'm sitting here waiting to just get my money back at 9
2014-10-05T02:37:42  <cosmo> aw, don't dump
2014-10-05T02:37:53  <cosmo> i hope kassado takes forever on the fix
2014-10-05T02:38:02  <techbytes> i'm glad i didn't like rby otherwise i would have gotten a lot of it...
2014-10-05T02:38:02  <cosmo> it gets dumped, whales get happy.. blah blah, the coin is landlocked
2014-10-05T02:38:17  <kenel> there's only two whales afaik
2014-10-05T02:38:24  <kenel> kassado and rawdawg
2014-10-05T02:38:52  <kenel> on the bright side for us, i don't think any one of us has big buy orders on DGC, and the price has been fairly consistent
2014-10-05T02:39:06  <cosmo> yeah
2014-10-05T02:39:13  <cosmo> we're at about 1btc a day in market volume
2014-10-05T02:39:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> checkcoin? archcoin? lol
2014-10-05T02:39:23  <cosmo> at 3k sats, 32k minted a day
2014-10-05T02:39:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> why on earth would you buy that stff?
2014-10-05T02:39:37  <kenel> wish we could just get on with this damn thing
2014-10-05T02:39:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *stuff?
2014-10-05T02:39:46  <cosmo> to dump it immediately when it hits the markets wolf
2014-10-05T02:39:47  <kenel> they do it for the same reason they bet on sports
2014-10-05T02:39:47  <kenel> lol
2014-10-05T02:39:51  <kenel> they can't help themselves :P
2014-10-05T02:40:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lawl
2014-10-05T02:40:12  <kenel> although i'm guilty of sports betting, but i give up on day coin trading
2014-10-05T02:40:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I bet on sports a few times
2014-10-05T02:40:22  <cosmo> xawksow_ was working on the windows executable kenel, but he's on vacation now
2014-10-05T02:40:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then I learned.
2014-10-05T02:40:25  <kenel> ethereum was the last coin i bought
2014-10-05T02:40:32  <kenel> and that'll literally be it
2014-10-05T02:40:33  <cosmo> and samson wanted to remove the mining from the qt-wallet anyway
2014-10-05T02:40:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I bought shitcoins a few times
2014-10-05T02:40:40  <kenel> i saw
2014-10-05T02:40:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then I learned
2014-10-05T02:40:46  <cosmo> lol yeha
2014-10-05T02:40:48  <kenel> but i don't think the mining can be removed
2014-10-05T02:41:03  <cosmo> wolf, i lost about 50% of what i gained on bitcoin so far trying to trade cryptos
2014-10-05T02:41:05  <kenel> i think ahmed responded in chat to why that dependency can't be removed
2014-10-05T02:41:23  <cosmo> hm, okay
2014-10-05T02:41:24  <kenel> am i missing something though
2014-10-05T02:41:36  <kenel> we're upgrading to latest btc source; shouldn't that be done before qt is compiled?
2014-10-05T02:41:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Then fucking stop.
2014-10-05T02:41:53  <cosmo> nah we pretty much stole Digibyte's thing
2014-10-05T02:41:59  <cosmo> Wolf|WinLaptop, for the most part i did
2014-10-05T02:42:14  <cosmo> i played with too large amounts, now i stick with 1btc in buy orders
2014-10-05T02:42:55  <kenel> then why does samson keep mentioning the upgrade to the latest source
2014-10-05T02:42:59  <cosmo> i am not a clever man, but if i win a little bit i can get some kinda self-confidence, even if i lose too
2014-10-05T02:43:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: I would recommend you stop doing it completely - you've learned it loses money more often than not
2014-10-05T02:43:23  <kenel> also stop responding to bcx cosmo :P
2014-10-05T02:44:10  <cosmo> well i've learned how not to lose my shirt, now i just lose my socks
2014-10-05T02:44:34  <kenel> 'he doesn't like you' - star wars :P
2014-10-05T02:45:21  <cosmo> heh, i've been trading 7 btc on trex for the past few months, i'm at ~7.3 now, so i'm learning
2014-10-05T02:45:35  <cosmo> DGC and MYR are my biggest losses
2014-10-05T02:45:44  <cosmo> LTC is my biggest gain from 10c to 2$
2014-10-05T02:46:43  <cosmo> i've definitely learned, got very, very lucky initially, then learned from losing what i got through luck. Still ahead, once I lost half I realized I was seriously fucking up and cut the faucet down to a drip.
2014-10-05T02:47:28  <cosmo> and yeah kenel, i'll try, maybe, idk
2014-10-05T02:47:38  <cosmo> we have to start self-modded threads, else he'll keep bugging us.
2014-10-05T02:48:01  <techbytes> that's why i put a lot of it in DGC so i don't lose them trading.
2014-10-05T02:48:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> [20:44:40]	cosmo	well i've learned how not to lose my shirt, now i just lose my socks
2014-10-05T02:48:34  <cosmo> i put a lot of them in DGC.. when it was 3k sats...
2014-10-05T02:48:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Then stop trading and do something like...
2014-10-05T02:48:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> idk, mine
2014-10-05T02:48:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> anything profitable
2014-10-05T02:48:50  <cosmo> ha
2014-10-05T02:48:54  <cosmo> that'd be getting employed
2014-10-05T02:49:03  <techbytes> then you dumped them at 1500 satoshi?
2014-10-05T02:49:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: That would suck, though
2014-10-05T02:49:25  <cosmo> yes i'm stupid, bought them back though through disclaimers dump techbytes
2014-10-05T02:49:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: I manage to be profitable and have never had a job in my life.
2014-10-05T02:49:50  <cosmo> i just never understood shame and mooch off my parents
2014-10-05T02:50:29  <cosmo> i've got a fair amount of cash saved, just not interested in being part of society
2014-10-05T02:51:34  <cosmo> also doing that is impossible Wolf|WinLaptop if you have no money initially
2014-10-05T02:51:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Oh?
2014-10-05T02:51:59  <cosmo> unless you sell drugs or prostitute or something, you need resources to aquire more resources
2014-10-05T02:52:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I am 19. Fresh out of HS
2014-10-05T02:52:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and I'm BROKE
2014-10-05T02:52:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> err... I was
2014-10-05T02:52:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I was worse than broke
2014-10-05T02:52:19  <cosmo> don't tell me DOGE saved you X|
2014-10-05T02:52:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> my mother charged me rent per month - so I was getting more broke all the time
2014-10-05T02:52:36  <cosmo> though awesome if it did, that's rad.
2014-10-05T02:52:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Nope
2014-10-05T02:52:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I made $15,000 in June selling a miner I made for XMR.
2014-10-05T02:52:55  <cosmo> so how're you living now?
2014-10-05T02:53:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I code.
2014-10-05T02:53:19  <kenel> i play vidya
2014-10-05T02:53:19  <cosmo> sigh
2014-10-05T02:53:25  <kenel> sometimes :P
2014-10-05T02:53:26  <cosmo> i hate things
2014-10-05T02:54:01  <techbytes> xmr as in the coin menero?
2014-10-05T02:54:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> techbytes: Yeah
2014-10-05T02:54:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: I went from nothing, to getting a laptop I badly needed. Took this in June (SFW): https://ottrbutt.com/7Y3XBMh.jpg

2014-10-05T02:54:31  <cosmo> that is impressive wolf
2014-10-05T02:54:36  <techbytes> wonder if they bought that before launch?
2014-10-05T02:54:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Unfortunately, loads of that went to my mother
2014-10-05T02:54:42  <kenel> well here's what i've got for tomorrow: http://i.imgur.com/sbAoCk2.png

2014-10-05T02:54:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> no, it was all after
2014-10-05T02:54:51  <techbytes> ok
2014-10-05T02:54:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I hadn't heard of XMR before
2014-10-05T02:55:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> anyway
2014-10-05T02:55:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 6.3x or so was my total increase over the best public miner at one point
2014-10-05T02:55:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> when it was CPU mined only
2014-10-05T02:55:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's released now
2014-10-05T02:56:49  <techbytes> i'm done with nitrogen... went from 1btc to 3 and now zip...
2014-10-05T02:56:55  <kenel> i suppose i should finally take a shower and put on pants
2014-10-05T02:57:00  <kenel> techbytes, that's why i only bet .02btc
2014-10-05T02:57:02  <kenel> no matter what
2014-10-05T02:57:08  <techbytes> i can't do that
2014-10-05T02:57:20  <techbytes> it's like monopoly money to me
2014-10-05T02:57:28  <kenel> lol, i used to have the same problem
2014-10-05T02:57:34  <kenel> but now i just enjoy it for...the sport of betting
2014-10-05T02:57:42  <kenel> i usually at least break even every weekend which is fine by me
2014-10-05T02:57:52  <techbytes> i was doing well just betting .1btc..
2014-10-05T02:57:53  <kenel> had this .1 btc for about 3 weeks now
2014-10-05T02:58:02  <kenel> down .02 btc from the game on monday though
2014-10-05T02:58:08  <cosmo> i got a cushy life
2014-10-05T02:58:09  <kenel> and i didn't bet (stupidly) on the packers
2014-10-05T02:58:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: I bet 1 BTC on a game before :P
2014-10-05T02:58:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Pretty sure that was the last time I bet.
2014-10-05T02:58:33  <kenel> wolf, i used to bet up to 10 btc per game
2014-10-05T02:58:35  <kenel> i don't anymore
2014-10-05T02:58:38  <kenel> .02btc is like nothing
2014-10-05T02:58:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: lol damn
2014-10-05T02:58:42  <kenel> !trade 0.02 btc
2014-10-05T02:58:43  <Coine1ius> (kenel) Something went wrong...
2014-10-05T02:58:48  <kenel> i won ~ 15k on the superbowl this year
2014-10-05T02:59:03  <kenel> i spent it all on overstock.com on a bunch of shit i wanted
2014-10-05T02:59:12  <kenel> and bought a shit ton of silver to go into the safe i bought
2014-10-05T02:59:39  <cosmo> i used to sell weed and cheap psychedelics
2014-10-05T03:00:18  <cosmo> it isn't worth it
2014-10-05T03:02:31  <techbytes> cosmo, bittrex listed archcoin.  You should buy some under 10k...  ICO price was 5960.
2014-10-05T03:03:44  <cosmo> doesn't look like it's up yet
2014-10-05T03:05:50  <techbytes> coins haven't been distributed
2014-10-05T03:07:12  <cosmo> they listed darkpeer
2014-10-05T03:10:55  <techbytes> damn, i dumped mine this morning on c-cex at 400 satoshi
2014-10-05T03:11:48  <techbytes> wasn't much but damn...  2500 on trex
2014-10-05T03:13:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: hey, speak for yourself when you say selling drugs isn't worth it!
2014-10-05T03:13:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It may not be for me or you
2014-10-05T03:14:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but if no one did, I'd be unhappy.
2014-10-05T03:20:04  <cosmo> heh, they are nice
2014-10-05T03:20:26  <cosmo> i don't bother with them much anymore, but mushrooms are easy enough to cultivate if you have your own place.
2014-10-05T03:20:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> no thanks
2014-10-05T03:20:59  <cosmo> :c
2014-10-05T03:21:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Shit, weed is very occasional for me
2014-10-05T03:21:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> however, I do need dextroamphetamine in bulk. And it ain't for selling it :P
2014-10-05T03:21:29  <cosmo> yeah, my foremost problem with drugs is that they cost money
2014-10-05T03:21:39  <cosmo> oh my god
2014-10-05T03:21:56  <cosmo> you aint chuggin tussin at least, are ya
2014-10-05T03:22:40  <cosmo> i knew a guy super into dxm, he now has a kid with a girl who likes heroin
2014-10-05T03:23:16  <cosmo> that kids in for some shit
2014-10-05T03:25:20  <cosmo> if you're into dxm at least get the concentrated powder
2014-10-05T03:25:43  <kenel> isn't that the ADHD pill?
2014-10-05T03:25:51  <kenel> like the same shit truckers and air force pilots use?
2014-10-05T03:26:03  <cosmo> that's adderall
2014-10-05T03:26:15  <cosmo> dxm is in cough syrup
2014-10-05T03:26:32  <cosmo> it's kinda fun if you're bored and dgaf
2014-10-05T03:26:51  <cosmo> like some kind of aztec mirage
2014-10-05T03:27:08  <cosmo> weeoooohhoooooeeeeeeewwweeeooooooooo
2014-10-05T03:27:35  <kenel> yeah i thought dex kept you alert
2014-10-05T03:28:42  <cosmo> eh, kinda sorta, i mean you're tripping so
2014-10-05T03:29:04  <cosmo> i'unno, go chug some tussin :P
2014-10-05T03:29:23  <kenel> wtf
2014-10-05T03:29:27  <cosmo> or get the gel capsules, they go down much easier. i actually have a bottle from years ago.
2014-10-05T03:29:27  <kenel> putty won't connect to anything
2014-10-05T03:30:13  <cosmo> if you're into dxm wolf, give mxe a shot, that's one i liked
2014-10-05T03:31:26  <cosmo> it felt a lot cleaner, but there's no plateau zones or anything of that sort, just a steady climb
2014-10-05T03:35:17  <kenel> god damnit
2014-10-05T03:35:27  <kenel> i can't get the server to download this backup file
2014-10-05T03:39:06  <cosmo> sure ya can

2014-10-05T03:40:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: no
2014-10-05T03:40:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> adderall
2014-10-05T03:40:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and dexedrine
2014-10-05T03:41:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> dxm is dextromethorphan, I believe
2014-10-05T03:41:28  <cosmo> yeah it is, i misread
2014-10-05T03:41:49  <kenel> anything with 'phetamine' is like speed :P
2014-10-05T03:42:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm prescribed the max dose allowed by DEA
2014-10-05T03:42:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but I get the rest elsewhere
2014-10-05T03:44:02  <cosmo> i sometimes wonder if it'd be worth getting diagnosed
2014-10-05T03:45:02  <cosmo> don't think i've ever tried stims aside from adderall
2014-10-05T03:47:46  <cosmo> drugs are great but real inspiration is a much deeper thing, if you don't got it drugs'll just throw you in a loop
2014-10-05T03:48:22  <cosmo> and man i've been around too many blockhead users to care anymore
2014-10-05T03:48:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Amphetamines are an expense.
2014-10-05T03:49:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I pop dexamph to code to make money to buy dexamph :P
2014-10-05T03:49:54  <cosmo> yeah, but i mean you had a fascination with coding before drugs, right
2014-10-05T03:51:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> yeah, course
2014-10-05T03:51:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but I wasn't as effective
2014-10-05T03:51:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> not because I wasn't able
2014-10-05T03:51:27  <kenel> be careful with that shit; doesn't it damage the fuck out of your liver?
2014-10-05T03:51:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but because I couldn't sit and do one thing
2014-10-05T03:51:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: nope
2014-10-05T03:51:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'll probably die of a heart attack or stroke, though
2014-10-05T03:51:55  <cosmo> yeah, some serious traders love stimulants, helps em rape the market :p
2014-10-05T03:52:26  <cosmo> conditions you to have a single point of focus, through the high
2014-10-05T03:53:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Sometimes
2014-10-05T03:54:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Often, I switch things, but in a far more controlled manner
2014-10-05T03:54:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> for example, if I need to wait on something
2014-10-05T03:54:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I switch to another task
2014-10-05T03:54:25  <kenel> so verizon gives you a tablet for free now if you pay 10$/month for it
2014-10-05T03:55:50  <cosmo> live how ya want man
2014-10-05T05:52:19  <RunningmanZ> cosmo:Both those bets Scrappy gave us lost :/
2014-10-05T05:52:27  <RunningmanZ> Lost .5 btc today
2014-10-05T05:52:41  <RunningmanZ> Oh well you win some u lose some
2014-10-05T06:03:45  <kenel> no one wins at sports betting except professional handicappers (which scrappy is not), and the house
2014-10-05T06:12:52  <RunningmanZ> Yeah his first two bets padi off but I'm down now so will give it a rest for a bit I think lol. I'm probably better off betting on the AFL when the season starts up again. I see they have AFL betting on there
2014-10-05T06:12:56  <RunningmanZ> paid*
2014-10-05T06:40:54  <kenel> i'm assuming then that you upped your bets?
2014-10-05T06:40:59  <kenel> you're not supposed to do that
2014-10-05T06:41:04  <kenel> especially when you're blindly following someone
2014-10-05T06:41:25  <kenel> professional handicappers weigh their bets based on confidence levels and how uneven the lines are
2014-10-05T06:41:47  <kenel> for example, when everyone was betting denver to win the superbowl, the odds went WAY the fuck up for the moneylines for seattle
2014-10-05T06:41:55  <kenel> i already had bets in on the ML
2014-10-05T06:42:03  <kenel> but once they went up, i put another 10btc on it

2014-10-05T11:34:34  *** nilz^off is now known as nilz
2014-10-05T11:46:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> CoHe:
2014-10-05T11:46:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> actually
2014-10-05T11:46:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I prefer days where the sun does not shine
2014-10-05T11:49:34  <CoHe> nooooo..why?
2014-10-05T11:49:42  <CoHe> I love the sun
2014-10-05T11:49:53  <CoHe> To each his own though
2014-10-05T11:52:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> CoHe: while I like the sun
2014-10-05T11:52:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I do not like it DIRECTLY
2014-10-05T11:52:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> shit's too goddamned hot and bright
2014-10-05T11:52:55  <CoHe> lolz
2014-10-05T11:53:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> A good day to me is cloudy but not rainy-looking
2014-10-05T11:53:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> maybe dew on the grass
2014-10-05T11:53:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> not sunny as fuck
2014-10-05T11:53:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> although tbh
2014-10-05T11:53:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> IMO night gives day a run for its money
2014-10-05T11:54:47  <CoHe> I do like the night
2014-10-05T11:55:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but, sadly
2014-10-05T11:55:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> here it is nearing 6AM
2014-10-05T11:58:04  <CoHe> Where you from Wolf?
2014-10-05T11:58:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> USA
2014-10-05T11:59:17  <CoHe> I am from the shitty EU..if I had the money for it i`d go live in the US.
2014-10-05T11:59:22  <CoHe> Maybe one day
2014-10-05T11:59:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lawl
2014-10-05T11:59:32  <Wolf|WinLaptop> A lot of the EU may suck
2014-10-05T11:59:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but I think it's about on par with how much the US sucks
2014-10-05T11:59:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Except we gots cheap power :P
2014-10-05T12:00:18  <CoHe> I doubt that EU is a big mess at the moment
2014-10-05T12:00:46  <CoHe> How can all these diffferent countries sort major issues when all have an equal say?
2014-10-05T12:00:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The USA elected George Bush - twice.
2014-10-05T12:00:59  <CoHe> Lolz
2014-10-05T12:01:02  <CoHe> thats true hahaha
2014-10-05T12:01:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> While you may have a bunch of differing opinions making it hard to get shit done
2014-10-05T12:01:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's better than one voice that's totally fucking stupid
2014-10-05T12:01:50  <CoHe> I dont know bout that i`d rather have one person making a bad call as no calls being made at alll
2014-10-05T12:02:02  <CoHe> still..George Bush
2014-10-05T12:02:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Not one person making A bad call
2014-10-05T12:02:54  <CoHe> I was watching CNN back then day and night when he was elected
2014-10-05T12:02:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's more like having a drooling idiot deciding the future of rocket technology
2014-10-05T12:03:03  <CoHe> I couldnt believe he was voted into office
2014-10-05T12:03:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> or a committee
2014-10-05T12:03:47  <CoHe> From an insiders view..you like Obama?
2014-10-05T12:05:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lawl
2014-10-05T12:06:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I had some hope for him
2014-10-05T12:07:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and tbh, he's gotten us some half-assed form of health care, which takes us one little step further away from the third world country we're fast becoming
2014-10-05T12:08:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But instead of denouncing the NSA's illegal activities like many in Congress, he instead said in his speech, and I quote, "We have to make a choice," going on to say that we need to give up freedoms for protection from the non-existent terrorists
2014-10-05T12:08:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and best part is, we DIDN'T make a choice, motherfucker. You made it for us.
2014-10-05T12:09:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Not even mentioning the absurdity of the general level of fear related to terrorism when you consider that starting from 1990 and going until now, more people have died from falling down stairs than from anything related to terroris
2014-10-05T12:09:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *terrorism
2014-10-05T12:10:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It's not even an actual term anymore, it's a buzzword
2014-10-05T12:10:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> You stretch its meaning in whatever way you need to to make it relevant to the shit you're on about so you can rile people up
2014-10-05T12:11:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So, yeah, kinda ranting
2014-10-05T12:11:37  <CoHe> I aggree with you there but keep people in fear makes them controled easy
2014-10-05T12:12:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but has he done at least SOME shit right? Yeah. Do I think he's spineless or downright uncaring about the public in some respects? Also yeah.
2014-10-05T12:12:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> CoHe: no shit
2014-10-05T12:12:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> that's the problem
2014-10-05T12:12:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they use fear to get people to forget they have rights
2014-10-05T12:12:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then they slowly erode them
2014-10-05T12:13:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The future often arrives on schedule, we just don't see it for what it is.
2014-10-05T12:13:36  <CoHe> Same going on here
2014-10-05T12:13:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> We have human-controlled killing machines - we call them cars.
2014-10-05T12:13:52  <CoHe> lolz
2014-10-05T12:13:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> George Orwell's 1984 is seen as unrealistic
2014-10-05T12:14:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> people will tell you, "Oh, there's no way the govt would get away with implanting tracking devices on us!"
2014-10-05T12:14:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Which is true - it's worse than that
2014-10-05T12:14:44  <CoHe> I would not put it past them
2014-10-05T12:15:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> They don't need to - you carry your cell everywhere. They don't need to make you register every friend you make with the government - you tell Facebook
2014-10-05T12:16:07  <CoHe> I dislike Facebook..only on it since a week now..for business purposes
2014-10-05T12:16:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 1984 has pretty much arrived :P
2014-10-05T12:16:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And me too
2014-10-05T12:16:32  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I don't use it
2014-10-05T12:16:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> nor Twitter
2014-10-05T12:16:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> although not entirely for privacy reasons, because let's face it
2014-10-05T12:16:58  <CoHe> same here..on it same time as twitter..business
2014-10-05T12:17:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> pretty much everything said on Freenode is likely being stored, too :P
2014-10-05T12:17:17  <CoHe> lolz
2014-10-05T12:17:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> actually, forget likely
2014-10-05T12:17:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I know it
2014-10-05T12:17:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> had a convo with a guy who worked for an NSA contractor
2014-10-05T12:17:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> he wasn't cleared or anything
2014-10-05T12:18:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so he knew jack shit about any secrets
2014-10-05T12:18:10  <CoHe> so 1984 has reallly arrived
2014-10-05T12:18:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but that stuff is apparently common knowledge
2014-10-05T12:18:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and yep
2014-10-05T12:18:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I mean, if the people gave more of a shit, they could have stopped this
2014-10-05T12:18:45  <samson_> yes, I'm sure everything said on IRC is all logged but who really cares
2014-10-05T12:18:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but I'm not even sure if they could, now
2014-10-05T12:18:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> In short...
2014-10-05T12:19:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> "We be fucked."
2014-10-05T12:19:34  <samson_> How are we fucked ?
2014-10-05T12:19:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: I care - not because things said on IRC are secret
2014-10-05T12:19:58  <CoHe> I go get some food..brb
2014-10-05T12:20:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but because it's going into the hands of people who make it their job to steal everything secret - it helps correlations
2014-10-05T12:20:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> if it were just random people logging
2014-10-05T12:20:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> who the fuck cares
2014-10-05T12:20:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: about us being fucked
2014-10-05T12:20:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> the govt has all the power
2014-10-05T12:20:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> if they want something to happen, it will
2014-10-05T12:20:53  <samson_> There's lot of different governments in the world
2014-10-05T12:20:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm worried the people couldn't overthrow it now if they suddenly started caring
2014-10-05T12:21:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: Oh, speaking of the US
2014-10-05T12:21:08  <samson_> Wh choose which one to live under
2014-10-05T12:21:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> you came in mid-convo
2014-10-05T12:21:11  <samson_> *We
2014-10-05T12:21:28  <samson_> yes, just got back to pc
2014-10-05T12:21:32  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: stupid way of thinking - we do, but you never know
2014-10-05T12:21:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Jews didn't decide to live in Germany and get massacred
2014-10-05T12:21:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they were there already, everything was just peachy...
2014-10-05T12:22:03  <samson_> Yet lots of them left and didn't get massacred
2014-10-05T12:22:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> until it wasn't
2014-10-05T12:22:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Yes, but the government also took steps to stop that from happening
2014-10-05T12:22:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and were fairly successful
2014-10-05T12:22:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> By the time people are trying to get out
2014-10-05T12:22:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's too late.

2014-10-05T16:43:30  <techbytes1_> not sure... dreday brought it up this morning...
2014-10-05T16:43:49  <techbytes1_> so bcx was at it taking down both pools..
2014-10-05T16:44:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Assuming it is BCX.
2014-10-05T16:44:19  <techbytes1_> yeah... timing points to him
2014-10-05T16:44:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I mean, if we knew whoever did it had a hate boner for DGC, then yeah, BCX would be the clear suspect
2014-10-05T16:45:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but somebody could just be looking to mine some coins at low diff

2014-10-05T18:35:30  <kenel> ok, well, guess i have to wait for xawksow_ i have no clue wtf i'm doing, lol
2014-10-05T18:40:43  <samson_> crons run automatically
2014-10-05T18:40:47  <samson_> at specific times
2014-10-05T18:40:50  <samson_> or intervals
2014-10-05T18:41:02  <samson_> To list them you can type this :
2014-10-05T18:41:05  <samson_> crontab -l
2014-10-05T18:41:23  <samson_> This will show the times/intervals along with the command it runs
2014-10-05T18:41:45  <samson_> If you want to manually run one you can see what t orun by looking at the output of 'crontab -l'
2014-10-05T18:42:04  <samson_> -l = l for list
2014-10-05T18:42:15  <kenel> he's got nothing
2014-10-05T18:42:21  <kenel> crontab -e is just comments
2014-10-05T18:42:48  <kenel> how the hell does he have the crons running
2014-10-05T18:43:02  <samson_> That's if they're under the user you're logged in as
2014-10-05T18:43:08  <kenel> ahhhhh
2014-10-05T18:43:31  <kenel> stratum@vps:~/nop$ crontab -l
2014-10-05T18:43:31  <kenel> no crontab for stratum
2014-10-05T18:43:36  <kenel> nothing under root either
2014-10-05T18:43:37  <samson_> I often run mine as root
2014-10-05T18:43:45  <samson_> there's a directory structure as well
2014-10-05T18:43:54  <samson_> for daily weekly etc
2014-10-05T18:44:28  <samson_> ls -la /etc/cron.hourly
2014-10-05T18:44:35  <samson_> ls -la /etc/cron.daily
2014-10-05T18:44:52  <samson_> ls -la /etc/cron.weekly, etc

2014-10-05T18:46:21  <kenel> nothing in any of those
2014-10-05T18:46:22  <kenel> shit
2014-10-05T18:46:29  <kenel> let me do history and see what commands he has run
2014-10-05T18:47:31  <kenel> is there a way to do history and only show what he ran that has 'dgc' in it?
2014-10-05T18:47:34  <kenel> i don't care about the other pools
2014-10-05T18:47:40  <samson_> yes
2014-10-05T18:47:43  <samson_> cd
2014-10-05T18:47:50  <samson_> grep dgc .bash_history
2014-10-05T18:48:15  <samson_> .bash_history should be the file where all the history has been saved
2014-10-05T18:48:17  <kenel> you're awesome
2014-10-05T18:48:23  <samson_> It's in the home directory

2014-10-05T18:50:57  <samson_> what is the screen command ?
2014-10-05T18:51:22  <kenel> i guess it keeps the screen open even though i don't have putty open
2014-10-05T18:51:51  <samson_> ok so the program it's running is dgc_stratum

2014-10-05T18:54:33  <samson_> it will continue to search for all files named the same
2014-10-05T18:54:43  <kenel> i should've asked xawksow how to restart in case something happened before he left

2014-10-05T18:54:53  <samson_> including directories like the above one
2014-10-05T18:55:18  <samson_> did the find complete without finding more ?
2014-10-05T18:55:23  <kenel> i think that's all it found; it went back to where i can enter commands again
2014-10-05T18:55:29  <samson_> ah ok
2014-10-05T18:55:41  <samson_> I'll look at that paste again one sec
2014-10-05T18:56:24  <samson_> maybe go back to the history directory and grab the last 200 commands
2014-10-05T18:56:25  <samson_> cd
2014-10-05T18:56:33  <samson_> tail -200 .bash_history
2014-10-05T18:56:46  <kenel> i think about half of them are going to be fucking around looking for shit
2014-10-05T18:56:49  <samson_> maybe it doesn't have dgc in the command

2014-10-05T18:59:34  <kenel> sorry i'm so clueless; really appreciate your help samson_
2014-10-05T18:59:41  <samson_> not sure what he's doing here
2014-10-05T18:59:50  <samson_> if he is still logged in somewhere then it won't show up in that file
2014-10-05T19:00:10  <samson_> maybe try the find command on bpc_stratum
2014-10-05T19:00:27  <samson_> Or do a find on all files with stratum
2014-10-05T19:00:36  <samson_> find / -name '*stratum*' -print

2014-10-05T19:03:16  <samson_> nah - that's databases - there's one directory for each mysel database
2014-10-05T19:03:29  <samson_> this shows directories and files
2014-10-05T19:03:42  <samson_> there is no difference, a directory is a file in linux
2014-10-05T19:04:09  <samson_> There appears to be multiple pools on this server as well by the looks of it
2014-10-05T19:04:24  <kenel> yeah, just care about dgc ;P
2014-10-05T19:05:17  <samson_> type in
2014-10-05T19:05:20  <samson_> ls -la /root/stratum_new/stratum-mining/externals/stratum/stratum
2014-10-05T19:05:29  <samson_> I don't think that's going to be it
2014-10-05T19:05:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: a directory is a file in linux... just like fuckin' everything else
2014-10-05T19:05:43  <samson_> yep !

2014-10-05T19:08:33  <kenel> let me see if i can whatsapp him
2014-10-05T19:08:50  <samson_> he might have a single script that restarts everything on there
2014-10-05T20:01:09  <techbytes1_> hey... just got back from my parents...
2014-10-05T20:01:24  <kenel> hey techbytes1_
2014-10-05T20:01:26  <techbytes1_> kenel, what are you log on as now?
2014-10-05T20:01:28  <techbytes1_> root?

2014-10-05T20:03:18  <kenel> do digitalcoind ?
2014-10-05T20:03:21  <techbytes1_> no...
2014-10-05T20:03:25  <techbytes1_> digitalcoind
2014-10-05T20:03:35  <kenel> command not found
2014-10-05T20:03:52  <techbytes1_> maybe he renamed it
2014-10-05T20:04:15  <techbytes1_> try dgc then hit tab twice

2014-10-05T20:05:24  <kenel> ok ./digitalcoind is taking a while to start
2014-10-05T20:05:29  <kenel> means it's doing something right?
2014-10-05T20:06:03  <techbytes1_> should start
2014-10-05T20:06:12  <techbytes1_> and get you back at the prompt
2014-10-05T20:06:34  <kenel> ok, waiting for prompt to come back
2014-10-05T20:07:15  <techbytes1_> press enter a few times
2014-10-05T20:07:32  <kenel> i think it's still loading
2014-10-05T20:08:17  <techbytes1_> i get this when I don't have daemon=1 in the config... so if he doesn't have it, then you need to do :  digitalcoind -daemon

2014-10-05T20:10:43  <samson_> therein lies the problem
2014-10-05T20:10:45  <kenel> ok the funds are now showing again
2014-10-05T20:10:50  <kenel> i was at -2900 dgc before
2014-10-05T20:10:53  <kenel> now it shows the funds
2014-10-05T20:11:00  <techbytes1_> type:  cd then enter
2014-10-05T20:11:03  <kenel> he does have a user stratum
2014-10-05T20:11:53  <techbytes1_> type :  dir and tell me  what you have.
2014-10-05T20:12:02  <kenel> bin
2014-10-05T20:12:06  <kenel> just a bin dir
2014-10-05T20:12:15  <techbytes1_> what's in there?
2014-10-05T20:12:51  <kenel> cd bin -> dir -> digitalcoind
2014-10-05T20:13:05  <techbytes1_> that's it?
2014-10-05T20:13:15  <kenel> yeah
2014-10-05T20:13:19  <kenel> he has a user stratum
2014-10-05T20:13:22  <kenel> should i su that?
2014-10-05T20:13:29  <techbytes1_> yeah
2014-10-05T20:13:45  <techbytes1_> is there a user nomp?

2014-10-05T20:15:49  <techbytes1_> that should start stratum
2014-10-05T20:16:28  <kenel> ok, stratum is started again
2014-10-05T20:16:35  <kenel> how the hell do i get these crons running again?
2014-10-05T20:16:47  <techbytes1_> wait a few minutes
2014-10-05T20:17:01  <techbytes1_> might run automatically now that stratum is going
2014-10-05T20:21:43  <kenel> i don't think so
2014-10-05T20:21:49  <kenel> i ran crontab -e and nothing was there
2014-10-05T20:22:13  <kenel> same thing

2014-10-05T20:24:34  <kenel> dgcv2
2014-10-05T20:24:41  <techbytes1_> go in there and should see : cronjobs

2014-10-05T20:27:04  <techbytes1_> hmmm... maybe it's seeing the old stratum?  or maybe the old stratum is running?
2014-10-05T20:27:16  <techbytes1_> and it's not seeing the new one?
2014-10-05T20:27:39  <kenel> now the pool went to 0mh/s
2014-10-05T20:27:40  <kenel> shit
2014-10-05T20:27:43  <techbytes1_> type :  ps aux | grep twistd
2014-10-05T20:28:02  <kenel> just one result
2014-10-05T20:28:07  <kenel> maybe those crons restart stratum?
2014-10-05T20:28:16  <techbytes1_> shouldn't
2014-10-05T20:28:24  <kenel> fucking goddamn
2014-10-05T20:28:34  <techbytes1_> try:  ps aux : grep nodejs
2014-10-05T20:29:20  <kenel> same, one result
2014-10-05T20:29:49  <techbytes1_> so go back into nop dir and run :  node init.js
2014-10-05T20:30:05  <kenel> maybe it's because i didn't run it as root
2014-10-05T20:30:22  <techbytes1_> i doubt xawksow_ would run it under root
2014-10-05T20:30:33  <kenel> shit, then wtf should i run it as
2014-10-05T20:30:50  <techbytes1_> is there a nomp user?

2014-10-05T20:31:19  <kenel> stratum and digitalcoin are the users
2014-10-05T20:31:30  <techbytes1_> then it's under stratum
2014-10-05T20:31:39  <techbytes1_> run it again under stratum user
2014-10-05T20:32:58  <kenel> ok stratum is running again

2014-10-05T20:33:49  <techbytes1_> maybe bcx is stress testing
2014-10-05T20:34:07  <techbytes1_> no problem... i've been there too many times... :)
2014-10-05T20:34:29  <kenel> i'm like a level 4 linux tech
2014-10-05T20:34:37  <kenel> i know some shit, but not this extensive
2014-10-05T20:35:10  <techbytes1_> me neither.. had to learn all this recently
2014-10-05T20:41:06  <techbytes1_> kenel, your stratum is crashing...
2014-10-05T20:41:15  <techbytes1_> any error messages?
2014-10-05T20:41:27  <kenel> how do i check?
2014-10-05T20:41:55  <techbytes1_> when you run :  node init.js  does it run it on the screen?
2014-10-05T20:42:02  <kenel> yep
2014-10-05T20:42:15  <techbytes1_> what do you see now?
2014-10-05T20:42:29  <techbytes1_> back a the prompt?
2014-10-05T20:42:29  <kenel> i just ran it again, all green
2014-10-05T20:42:44  <kenel> do i need to do something like screen -S or something?
2014-10-05T20:43:00  <techbytes1_> probably to see it on the screen
2014-10-05T20:43:13  <kenel> i'm watching it now
2014-10-05T20:43:22  <kenel> how can i run init.js but have it run in the background?
2014-10-05T20:43:57  <kenel> soon as i ctrl+c to exit out of that, it looks like it crashes
2014-10-05T20:44:15  <techbytes1_> don't know cause i install "forever" to run init.js....
2014-10-05T20:44:30  <techbytes1_> no, if you run it like that, you need to leave it
2014-10-05T20:44:43  <techbytes1_> if you do ctrl+c, that will stop it
2014-10-05T20:44:52  <samson_> how about running it in the background ?
2014-10-05T20:45:04  <techbytes1_> don't know the command
2014-10-05T20:45:10  <samson_> It's easy
2014-10-05T20:45:22  <techbytes1_> if you know it yes.. :)
2014-10-05T20:45:32  <samson_> Just add a space and the & character after the command and it will run in the bakground
2014-10-05T20:45:45  <samson_> It should stay running even after you logout
2014-10-05T20:45:54  <techbytes1_> there you go... i just learn something new.
2014-10-05T20:46:04  <samson_> that might vary between unix and linux versions
2014-10-05T20:46:11  <techbytes1_> kenel, try that
2014-10-05T20:46:11  <kenel> node init.js & ?
2014-10-05T20:47:08  <samson_> no question mark on the end
2014-10-05T20:47:31  <samson_> just whatever you entered before with a space and a &
2014-10-05T20:47:41  <samson_> It should show oyu a process id and return you to the prompt
2014-10-05T20:47:49  <samson_> *you
2014-10-05T20:48:29  <samson_> if it created output to the screen I don't know what happens to it - maybe it gets emailed
2014-10-05T20:48:53  <samson_> Yes, you'll see something like this :
2014-10-05T20:48:53  <samson_> [1] 4916
2014-10-05T20:49:29  <samson_> if you then type 'ps auxw | grep node' you should see it as a process in the output
2014-10-05T20:55:40  <kenel> yeah so no matter what i do, it just runs
2014-10-05T20:55:50  <kenel> i keep hitting ctrl + c and it just goes back
2014-10-05T20:55:57  <kenel> do i need to leave putty open?
2014-10-05T20:56:21  <samson_> So is it going into the background ?
2014-10-05T20:56:34  <samson_> If it goes into the background you should be ok to clos eputty
2014-10-05T20:56:37  <kenel> no, it's just running
2014-10-05T20:56:47  <samson_> Did you try the & thing ?
2014-10-05T20:56:50  <kenel> but if i ctrl + c, it doesn't close it anymore
2014-10-05T20:56:53  <kenel> it just keeps running
2014-10-05T20:57:04  <samson_> So you stopped it
2014-10-05T20:57:12  <techbytes1_> well, leave putty open for now.  until xawksow_ comes back
2014-10-05T20:57:17  <samson_> and started it again adding a space and an & onto the end
2014-10-05T20:57:24  <kenel> yeah
2014-10-05T20:57:25  <samson_> and it didn't go into the background ?
2014-10-05T20:57:31  <samson_> What linux is this ?
2014-10-05T20:57:32  <kenel> node init.js &
2014-10-05T20:57:45  <samson_> Yes - that should do it normally
2014-10-05T20:58:07  <kenel> it's debian
2014-10-05T20:58:22  <samson_> That's how you can launch a daemon type program into the background manually
2014-10-05T20:58:35  <kenel> as long as it runs and doesn't shut down
2014-10-05T20:58:35  <kenel> idk
2014-10-05T20:58:37  <kenel> thank you guys
2014-10-05T20:59:09  <samson_> did you try pressing 'enter'
2014-10-05T20:59:34  <kenel> yeah, does nothing

2014-10-05T21:02:18  <samson_> it also mentions screen so you can come back to it - there were numerous screen commands in the pastebins from earlier so that's possibly how he was running it
2014-10-05T21:04:04  <techbytes1_> i run forever only because ahmed_ had it running when he setup the pools before.  That and i didn't know how to run it in the background.
2014-10-05T21:04:58  <techbytes1_> cosmo, did you get any archcoin?
2014-10-05T21:05:13  <samson_> The only problem with background processes is you usually need something to monitor if they're still running or not
2014-10-05T21:06:32  <techbytes1_> yeah... i only find out when miners complaints

2014-10-06T00:18:36  <kenel> no
2014-10-06T00:18:38  <kenel> he is going to war on cosmo
2014-10-06T00:18:50  <RunningmanZ> which reflects back on us :/
2014-10-06T00:19:10  <kenel> i realize that, as does cosmo, hence his 'sorry guys'
2014-10-06T00:19:18  <kenel> right now, i'm a little angry, so i'll just come back later
2014-10-06T00:19:39  <RunningmanZ> join the club im over BCX's shit
2014-10-06T00:20:03  <RunningmanZ> he runs that place it seems
2014-10-06T00:23:25  <RunningmanZ> The mods are pathetic on BCT, let blatant trolling run rampant
2014-10-06T00:23:30  <samson_> Could we delete the thread where the address is mentioned and then call him a thief ?
2014-10-06T00:23:57  <RunningmanZ> We should post in that thread and ask the mods to lock it due to trolling
2014-10-06T00:24:17  <samson_> The original thread woud need deleting as it lists the same address
2014-10-06T00:24:59  <samson_> Then move the coins and say they were sold by BCX and ask him to post all his DGC addresses ASAP lol
2014-10-06T00:26:36  <RunningmanZ> lol
2014-10-06T00:27:02  <RunningmanZ> Seriously tho how can the mods let threads like that start??
2014-10-06T00:27:24  <RunningmanZ> Thats just blatant trolling and repeating teh same shit he has posted numerous times in other threads
2014-10-06T00:37:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> RunningmanZ: The mods let it pass because they prefer the only censorship to happen in self-modded threads
2014-10-06T00:37:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Only total spam and scammers have even a chance of being banned/moderated
2014-10-06T00:37:48  <samson_> Every thread we make should be self moderated
2014-10-06T00:37:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> They're also possibly corrupt.
2014-10-06T00:38:17  <RunningmanZ> Wolf|WinLaptop:No doubt I think alot are corrupt
2014-10-06T00:38:45  <RunningmanZ> I wouldn't be surprised if they let him have open slather because he has DDOS'd that forum before and they are scared of him.
2014-10-06T00:38:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> RunningmanZ: While I think that's true - this isn't evidence of it
2014-10-06T00:38:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol
2014-10-06T00:38:53  <samson_> Well there's the forum software donation fund which contained 1000's of BTC - something like 3600+ if I remember correctly and they never did get another forum did they....
2014-10-06T00:38:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> no.
2014-10-06T00:39:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Theymos could step on BCX like an ant.
2014-10-06T00:39:32  <RunningmanZ> I'm pretty sure I heard something about him attacking the forum he def has done it to Cryptsy and other places
2014-10-06T00:39:59  <RunningmanZ> Wolf|WinLaptop:How can they if they don't know who he is?
2014-10-06T00:40:24  <RunningmanZ> I'm sure they are alot of ppl who want to step on him. A long line actually
2014-10-06T00:40:30  <samson_> He was bragging about attacking btc-e at one point I believe - of course it could be bullshit but who knows
2014-10-06T00:40:46  <cosmo> that has to be bullshit
2014-10-06T00:41:07  <RunningmanZ> Lol the mod on the board has gambling in his sig. Says it all really
2014-10-06T00:41:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> RunningmanZ: The thing is - people are scared of BCX because he's got a lot of money and hashpower

2014-10-06T00:41:14  <samson_> Baritus mentioned having to pay bribes along the way to various people, he said this is common for coin devs. I suspect he stopped paying at some point and then BCX came around
2014-10-06T00:41:29  <cosmo> it's whatever, i just wanted to get the first response to that thread so i could call him a troll in huge font.
2014-10-06T00:41:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> If BCX has money like a drug dealer, Theymos has got it like a national bank
2014-10-06T00:41:56  <RunningmanZ> or BCX is paying them off or blackmailing
2014-10-06T00:42:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> RunningmanZ: Possible.
2014-10-06T00:42:04  <samson_> So Baritus was threatened into paying bribes over time - this is a dirty business
2014-10-06T00:42:06  <RunningmanZ> would not be surprised
2014-10-06T00:42:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: That's probably just the tip of the iceberg.
2014-10-06T00:42:46  <RunningmanZ> i tried to get some of his posts deleted before and the mods did fkall even when I PM'd them and asked nicely with what I felt were valid reasons
2014-10-06T00:42:50  <samson_> I can only imagine !
2014-10-06T00:43:35  <RunningmanZ> maybe Kenel can email this mod and ask? https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=51173

2014-10-06T00:43:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: Consider this: almost every coin ever launched, except BTC, really, has been taken advantage of by farmers with far faster miners, usually on the order of 2.5x to 3x or more - WAAAAAAAY more, in the case of XMR
2014-10-06T00:43:41  <samson_> I suspect BCx is building a 'pretext' so he can make demands on DGC. We should stick to our guns and tell him to go fuck himself
2014-10-06T00:44:27  <RunningmanZ> samson_:im sure he has already scammed alot out of us already with his FUD campaigns
2014-10-06T00:44:33  <RunningmanZ> thru PnD
2014-10-06T00:44:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Don't pay BCX off or anything - but do your best not to provoke him.
2014-10-06T00:44:50  <samson_> I buy the dumps and will continue to do so
2014-10-06T00:51:02  <samson_> I think we should work this BCX character up into a bit of a frenzy - really piss him off and make him reveal his true colours as a spoilt brat, liar and fraudster
2014-10-06T00:51:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> No.
2014-10-06T00:51:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Everyone knows BCX is a piece of shit.
2014-10-06T00:52:16  <samson_> Are you all really scared of him ?
2014-10-06T00:52:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The only thing you would accomplish is getting him to burn a lot of cash on trying to kill DGC
2014-10-06T00:52:35  <samson_> Or is he just a troll ?
2014-10-06T00:52:49  <samson_> Baritus often dismissed him as a troll
2014-10-06T00:53:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: I'm not scared of BCX - but I do know that he's rich - most rich people are like small children with machine guns
2014-10-06T00:53:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they're immature and can throw highly destructive tantrums
2014-10-06T00:53:23  <samson_> Yet others said he isn't a troll and is a serious hacker so I don't know what to believe
2014-10-06T00:53:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: He is damned good - or was.
2014-10-06T00:53:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But his trick nowadays is to only kill a coin once in a while
2014-10-06T00:54:00  <samson_> Is there any way I could benefit from BCX throwing an expensive tantrum ?
2014-10-06T00:54:11  <samson_> Can you really permanently kill a coin ?
2014-10-06T00:54:26  <samson_> If it still has backing and buyers regardless of what happens....
2014-10-06T00:54:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> What they does is, it allows him to do more P & D scams from saying he's gonna kill it - the sheep will believe him because he has in the past - and he only has to do it rarely
2014-10-06T00:55:13  <samson_> There are people out there who will buy millions of dumped DGC at low prices no matter how low the price goes
2014-10-06T00:55:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> You can fuck the chain extremely badly and ensure no one will have faith in it ever again, yeah
2014-10-06T00:56:00  <samson_> Doesn;t that only happen when the community around the coin gives up ?
2014-10-06T00:56:30  <samson_> I haven't really paid much attention to anything he's destroyed - any examples that I could research ?
2014-10-06T00:57:30  <samson_> There has been talk of a DGC buyback offer recently where an organised fund would attempt to buy all the DGC
2014-10-06T00:57:43  <samson_> From anyone who wanted to sell it
2014-10-06T00:58:23  <samson_> To take it off the market
2014-10-06T00:58:30  <samson_> long term
2014-10-06T01:01:05  <cosmo> if BCX does decide to focus on killing DGC merged-mining is probably the only thing that'd save us
2014-10-06T01:01:32  <cosmo> he can control the chain, and in response we could release v3 with a rollback, right?
2014-10-06T01:01:35  <samson_> He said either X11 or merged mining will not help - he is all powerful
2014-10-06T01:02:00  <samson_> We control the client and the checkpoints - he can't change that
2014-10-06T01:02:57  <samson_> I'm not that familiar with the way checkpoints work but I know they are created as time moves on - anyone got more information on this ? Could this process be made more robust ?
2014-10-06T01:03:50  <samson_> Some checkpoints are hard coded in the client so there is no way they could ever be circumvented. I remember Baritus posting something about using p2pool to create more checkpoints...
2014-10-06T01:03:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> If BCX decides he wants to kill DGC
2014-10-06T01:04:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I may be able to borrow on the order of 4.4GH/s X11
2014-10-06T01:06:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Note, I said may
2014-10-06T01:06:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so while it's not a sure thing
2014-10-06T01:07:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 4.4GH/s (I'm estimating very low, likely higher) of X11 hashrate is mining right now, and I know the dude with it and can work something out
2014-10-06T01:08:17  <cosmo> i dunno
2014-10-06T01:09:24  <cosmo> well i'm for merged-mining.. we can always update the 3rd algo later on anyway
2014-10-06T01:09:39  <samson_> Wolf: That's a lot of hash
2014-10-06T01:09:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So likely 5GH/s of X11, but drumming up more than that will be quite costly - my other farmer may be shutting down due to power cost increase - not a sure thing yet, though - so it means he would have to spin up all the rigs.
2014-10-06T01:10:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: Well, if he didn't underclock and undervolt, it'd be 6.27GH/s
2014-10-06T01:10:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> or so
2014-10-06T01:10:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> On my farmer class scale
2014-10-06T01:11:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> he's a balling farmer
2014-10-06T01:11:55  <samson_> I still wonder why the proof of work methods stick to just hashing when there's a lot of other things that could be done - lack of imagination ?
2014-10-06T01:12:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> If I have enough money to cover my living expenses, I can just tell him he doesn't owe me for 2mo or so if he points the lot at DGC
2014-10-06T01:12:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: just because they can be done doesn't mean doing them isn't incredibly stupid :P
2014-10-06T01:13:04  <samson_> sure, nor otherwise
2014-10-06T01:13:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The characteristics of hashing for a number under a target are ideal - pretty much everything else is not, and this is why
2014-10-06T01:13:56  <samson_> throw in a couple of point multiplications between hashes and everything else stays the same - you end up with a hash and a target - it's just more complex to get to it
2014-10-06T01:14:40  <samson_> Eg hash - generate public key on a curve - hash that and use the end result to see if meets the target
2014-10-06T01:14:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Full nodes must verify every single block in the chain - therefore, the PoW must be hard to create, but /very easy to verify/ -- also, the type of work done must be exactly reproducible; that is to say, everyone must get the same answer
2014-10-06T01:14:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> This severely limits the options
2014-10-06T01:15:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Also, shit like multiplications are already done
2014-10-06T01:15:11  <samson_> Yes, that's easy to verify - you add the public key and the hash to the block
2014-10-06T01:15:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> look at M7
2014-10-06T01:15:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they do 7 diff hashes
2014-10-06T01:15:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then they multiply them
2014-10-06T01:15:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> bignum
2014-10-06T01:15:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> before taking that result and hashing it
2014-10-06T01:15:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> which is the final hash
2014-10-06T01:16:22  <kenel> !seen baritus
2014-10-06T01:16:23  <Coine1ius> I last saw baritus at 24.09.2014 01:10
2014-10-06T01:16:55  <samson_> I'm talking about using the initial hash as an EC privkey, generate pubkey (using time consuming point multiplication) and hash the pubkey for the result - all that would be needed is two hashes - to verify and one point mul
2014-10-06T01:17:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> aren't point muls comparably slow?
2014-10-06T01:17:38  <samson_> changes the nature of hashing a lot but verification is still simple as you only need to do 1
2014-10-06T01:17:56  <samson_> yes they are slow when you need to do millions of them but for 1 per block it's irrelevant
2014-10-06T01:18:21  <samson_> It fits the description of POW - hard to create, simple to verify
2014-10-06T01:18:43  <samson_> Nobody does anything like this that I've heard of
2014-10-06T01:19:24  <kenel> well someone is finding about 95% of blocks right now
2014-10-06T01:19:30  <kenel> with ~ 4+gh/s
2014-10-06T01:20:45  <samson_> cheap coins incoming ? I still have a lot of coins to buy, I'm only at about 300k right now and I want them all - I know this is unrealistic but I'm going to get as many as I can afford to lose
2014-10-06T01:21:24  <cosmo> great
2014-10-06T01:21:38  <cosmo> there needs to be a way to kill people through the internet
2014-10-06T01:21:43  <samson_> Once V3 goes online in a few weeks the supply will be massively cut so the time to accumulate is right now
2014-10-06T01:22:03  <kenel> i'm thinking it might be bcx stress testing
2014-10-06T01:22:07  <kenel> he must be renting hash
2014-10-06T01:22:12  <samson_> maybe
2014-10-06T01:22:17  <samson_> I hope he sells them
2014-10-06T01:22:25  <RunningmanZ> I think we need to be assertive with him but careful in our responses. He has tried to hurt DGC before I'm sure. It hasn't worked so can I'm not sure what he can do now
2014-10-06T01:22:50  <cosmo> perhaps BCX gets contacted by whales looking to accumulate
2014-10-06T01:22:52  <RunningmanZ> he has loaded up alot of has on us before teh hasrate has been high numerous times in the past few months
2014-10-06T01:23:22  <cosmo> if it breaks it breaks :D
2014-10-06T01:23:24  <samson_> He is probably accumulating as many coins as he can, maybe he will dump them all to try and make DGC fail after V3 goes live
2014-10-06T01:23:48  <cosmo> who knows
2014-10-06T01:24:08  <samson_> Just need to be ready to respond to that
2014-10-06T01:24:26  <cosmo> having a client to push would be that response
2014-10-06T01:25:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Well, depending on how much money you guys have in your DGC slush fund
2014-10-06T01:25:32  <Wolf|WinLaptop> you could just, you know, pay someone to solve your problem.
2014-10-06T01:25:41  <RunningmanZ> why hasn't it broken before tho with attacks? Thats why I think he can't do shit
2014-10-06T01:25:49  <RunningmanZ> Just the usual threats and FUD
2014-10-06T01:25:53  <samson_> Was it attacked ?
2014-10-06T01:25:57  <cosmo> true wolf
2014-10-06T01:26:05  <RunningmanZ> Well according to Baritus at least 20 times or more
2014-10-06T01:26:16  <RunningmanZ> I rememebr him mentioning it
2014-10-06T01:26:23  <cosmo> baritus could make a windows executable
2014-10-06T01:26:28  <samson_> why did these attacks fail ?
2014-10-06T01:26:41  <cosmo> they might not have been attacks
2014-10-06T01:26:45  <samson_> We will make a windows executable, just a small problem to fix before that can be done
2014-10-06T01:26:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Actually, you may not even ahve to pay for the solution all by yourself
2014-10-06T01:26:57  <techbytes1_>  i'm going to create a new moderated thread and address his questions with a notice that all his bullshit posts will be deleted...
2014-10-06T01:27:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm sure there's a lot of people who want to see BCX in a pine box :P

2014-10-06T01:27:20  <RunningmanZ> 8.8 GH/s on 26 Sep
2014-10-06T01:27:25  <cosmo> may as well techbytes, more DGC threads on the forums the better, if he's gonna kill us we can't stop it
2014-10-06T01:27:25  <RunningmanZ> we are still alive
2014-10-06T01:27:36  <samson_> He might be targeting the pools
2014-10-06T01:27:45  <samson_> Stress testing them, etc
2014-10-06T01:28:08  <RunningmanZ> 4.4GH/s in July etc
2014-10-06T01:28:15  <samson_> Attack by taking out the infrastructure
2014-10-06T01:28:15  <RunningmanZ> we have been ok
2014-10-06T01:28:46  <samson_> We should get some clones of the pools setup and ready to go on the backend
2014-10-06T01:28:48  <RunningmanZ> i think we just need to be measured in our responses and get ppl on our side
2014-10-06T01:32:58  <samson_> Nearly all BCX's posts lately have been related to DGC, like 90% in the last few days
2014-10-06T01:33:15  <samson_> He's obsessed with DGC
2014-10-06T01:33:46  <samson_> I suspect he spends more time thinking about DGC than we do
2014-10-06T01:39:45  <RunningmanZ> I just posted a request in the thread asking for it to be locked

2014-10-06T01:51:27  <cosmo> it's over, just stop replying
2014-10-06T01:51:45  <cosmo> if DGC doesn't break with this extra hash then BCX is definitely hoarding the coin
2014-10-06T01:52:08  <cosmo> he just shittalks coins he wants to get a larger position in, simple
2014-10-06T01:53:04  <cosmo> i've been thinking about picking up more monero based on his spam
2014-10-06T01:54:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: XMR is a great coin
2014-10-06T01:54:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> except the PoW
2014-10-06T01:55:29  <techbytes1_> cosmo, you got RZ started and now you're telling him to stop... :)
2014-10-06T01:57:14  <cosmo> market cap is a little high wolf but yeah, seems alright
2014-10-06T01:58:00  <cosmo> did you read BCX's last post tech, blah blah blah LOL
2014-10-06T01:58:23  <cosmo> he clearly isn't trying to prove anything, i don't think he's going to break DGC.
2014-10-06T01:59:07  <cosmo> i kinda wanna pm him and see if he's up to something else..
2014-10-06T01:59:35  <cosmo> that account is a sockpuppet meant to help manipulate markets i'm pretty sure, perhaps i can gain his respect and glean some inside info
2014-10-06T01:59:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: no, I mean
2014-10-06T02:00:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I have firsthand knowledge 25% or more of XMR's nethash is botnets - meaning that I would guess the actual amount is quite a bit higher, perhaps 35% - 40%
2014-10-06T02:01:09  <cosmo> yeah, that's the norm with CPU coins isn't it?
2014-10-06T02:01:40  <cosmo> what's it matter if it's run by botnets?
2014-10-06T02:02:05  <techbytes1_> need to stop posting in that thread... just ignore him... you can talk shit about him in the new moderated thread...  :)
2014-10-06T02:02:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> uh... they got their coins for free and therefore won't care what the price is when they exit?
2014-10-06T02:03:10  <techbytes1_> !trade 400000
2014-10-06T02:03:10  <Coine1ius> 400000 DGC equals 11.71600056 BTC or 3749.12$
2014-10-06T02:03:49  <cosmo> leads to a more honest market then wolf
2014-10-06T02:04:17  <techbytes1_> what's a good price to set the 10 btc buy wall on dgc?  our first buyback...
2014-10-06T02:04:45  <cosmo> it hasn't fallen below 3000 much :s it'd be more worth it to put the wall on btc38
2014-10-06T02:05:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: honest? Farmers have bills to pay - it means that they care about the health of the coin and won't sell at any old price; there are many ways to monetize a botnet, and therefore they don't give a shit if they kill the coin
2014-10-06T02:05:07  <techbytes1_> going to be on bittrex
2014-10-06T02:05:53  <cosmo> techbytes1_ i mean do we actually want the coins or is this just to liven up the markets? if so then yeah trex
2014-10-06T02:06:21  <cosmo> and Wolf huh? they'd have to sell regardless to pay the bills, 'health' of the coin doesn't matter
2014-10-06T02:06:22  <techbytes1_> the goal is still one million dgc..
2014-10-06T02:06:29  <cosmo> inflated price isn't health :p
2014-10-06T02:06:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Yes it does.
2014-10-06T02:07:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> See, the farmers are unlikely to dump when the price is down - hell, they're unlikely to dump at all, but sell slowly so they don't kill it - at least, they will if they think it's a good coin
2014-10-06T02:07:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's not selling itself that's the issue
2014-10-06T02:07:45  <techbytes1_> not sure what you guys are talking about but if coin is not healthy, there's no profit.
2014-10-06T02:07:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's the manner in which they sell, and at what price they sell.
2014-10-06T02:09:43  <cosmo> i kinda see, miners will mine coins they believe will get appreciation, since they'll have less hash anyway at the time
2014-10-06T02:10:12  <cosmo> i thought most large operations just go for whatever's profitable at the time; hence pump coins always having tons of hash
2014-10-06T02:15:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: some do, others don't, others split their farms

2014-10-06T02:18:47  <kenel> Answer the questions directly,
2014-10-06T02:18:47  <kenel> Is Baritus in any way associated with or working with Digitalcoin?
2014-10-06T02:18:47  <kenel> Will he be allowed back in the future?
2014-10-06T02:18:47  <kenel> Will you disavow him?
2014-10-06T02:20:23  <kenel> patriots better fucking win

2014-10-06T02:43:10  <cosmo> so long as it doesn't devolve into pure shitposting, best to just say a few things that are positive to dgc

2014-10-06T02:43:32  <kenel> i turned it sentimental
2014-10-06T02:43:36  <cosmo> if he doesn't break DGC, then he's only trying to gather more of it.

2014-10-06T02:46:40  <RunningmanZ> We have recently begun restructuring the DGC community for the better with the creation of this Foundation and are trying to promote Digitalcoin in a fair and openminded fashion.
2014-10-06T02:46:40  <RunningmanZ> The following thread created by BCX is related to an ongoing issue he has with the previous Digitalcoin dev who no longer is associated with Digitalcoin development or the Foundation. Are you able to please lock this thread as has been spammed numerous times already by BCX and has nothing to do with the current and future development of Digitalcoin
2014-10-06T02:46:41  <RunningmanZ> . As a consequence it is hurting the fair promotion of our coin. We have asked BCX to refrain but he will not listen to our requests.

2014-10-06T03:53:31  <cosmo> in any case responding to him is losing, just say one thing to discredit his bullshit and move on
2014-10-06T03:53:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> from a song

2014-10-06T09:26:34  <CoHe> Morning peeps
2014-10-06T09:36:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> CoHe: what are you up to?
2014-10-06T09:36:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It's quiet on IRC, and I want to talk to people!
2014-10-06T09:36:15  <CoHe> Getting ready for a meeting
2014-10-06T09:36:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Where do these fuckers get off thinking they can sleep at 3:30AM?
2014-10-06T09:36:36  <CoHe> lol
2014-10-06T09:36:42  <CoHe> What you up to?
2014-10-06T09:37:18  <CoHe> Meeting starts at 15.00 but its 10.37 here and I am fully dressed and ready way to early
2014-10-06T09:39:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm testing my miner on a 290 and 270X one of my testers has
2014-10-06T09:39:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> dude says his 270X does 1250/1500 on the clocks
2014-10-06T09:39:49  <CoHe> I see.Worked ok?
2014-10-06T09:39:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> We're gonna find out
2014-10-06T09:41:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> right, I'm in - he's going to bed now, too >.<
2014-10-06T09:41:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Well, got full access to the rig again
2014-10-06T09:41:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so I can test
2014-10-06T09:41:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> he recently got a new router
2014-10-06T09:41:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so my access was fucked there for a bit
2014-10-06T09:42:58  <CoHe> How much you put out total?
2014-10-06T09:43:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Off my own?
2014-10-06T09:45:20  <CoHe> yup
2014-10-06T09:45:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Between me, my testers, and my farmer - the last being the vast majority, of course, I can get more than 5GH/s X11
2014-10-06T09:46:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The only rig I use to mine X11 currently is Freya, containing a 270X, 280X, 290X, and 7950, and hashing around 22 - 23MH/s X11
2014-10-06T09:47:15  <CoHe> That is alot of hashing power
2014-10-06T09:47:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol, sure is.
2014-10-06T09:47:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Believe me, if he didn't undervolt them
2014-10-06T09:47:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> he'd have around 5.7 - 5.8GH/s with my code
2014-10-06T09:48:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> wait, more
2014-10-06T09:48:16  <CoHe> You have it on DGC only?
2014-10-06T09:48:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 6.2GH/s
2014-10-06T09:48:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> DGC? It's not even live with X11 yet
2014-10-06T09:48:48  <CoHe> ah true
2014-10-06T09:50:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I might decide to put Freya on DGC when it goes live.
2014-10-06T09:50:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Well, for whenever she's doing X11
2014-10-06T09:50:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I also need to test X13 & x15
2014-10-06T09:54:22  <CoHe> You play any games Wolf?
2014-10-06T09:57:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Yeah - usually not multiplayer, though
2014-10-06T09:59:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> A 270X if I OC it high does just fine, though
2014-10-06T10:00:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> might need slightly more for Skyrim on the memory side - I ran it with a 7950 at the time
2014-10-06T10:01:33  <CoHe> :)
2014-10-06T10:03:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> odd...
2014-10-06T10:04:00  <CoHe> What is?

2014-10-06T10:04:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It seems that sgminer is compiling the wrong cl files - getting stock hashrate.
2014-10-06T10:04:37  <CoHe> hmm that is odd indeed
2014-10-06T10:07:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Gonna try on another rig of his
2014-10-06T10:12:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> oookay, starting it now
2014-10-06T10:12:55  <CoHe> :)
2014-10-06T10:13:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> nah - something's wrong with his PiMP setups
2014-10-06T10:13:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'll have to tell him when he wakes
2014-10-06T10:13:43  <CoHe> Wake him up!
2014-10-06T10:14:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> All other testers, and I, have 5.7MH/s on the 280X, 4.1MH/s is stock
2014-10-06T10:14:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol, I can't - not like I can use Wake On LAN to start him up like a rig :P
2014-10-06T10:14:47  <CoHe> lolz would be cool though
2014-10-06T10:15:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol it would be pretty awesome
2014-10-06T10:19:42  <CoHe> Unions would have some objections to it though
2014-10-06T10:20:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Nah - they might object to it being used on workers, though xD

2014-10-06T23:10:23  <cosmo> i've stopped responding, just watch out for the new threads he makes and put a big fat disclaimer calling his bullshit out
2014-10-06T23:10:25  <cosmo> leave it at that
2014-10-06T23:10:39  <cosmo> he just draws people on and on and on and on
2014-10-06T23:11:14  <cosmo> on the bright side it is bringing more attention to DGC :)
2014-10-06T23:11:24  <cosmo> and given the facts there's nothing wrong with DGC, so fuck him.

2014-10-06T23:26:25  <cosmo> it's what it is, just try to get the first post on whatever new topics BCX makes
2014-10-06T23:26:52  <cosmo> and hell bump it anyway, gets people looking at DGC fwiw
2014-10-06T23:29:24  <RunningmanZ> self moderation for the win

2014-10-06T23:36:56  <samson_> So Baritus is still watching but not posting
2014-10-06T23:37:49  <cosmo> yeah, i looked at that earlier
2014-10-06T23:40:03  <cosmo> just send him a friendly pm
2014-10-06T23:52:41  <cosmo> aw noo samson_, you know he'll pull up baritus' last active date on the forums and rub that in your face
2014-10-06T23:52:49  <cosmo> FUURRR DURRRRDHURRRRRRRRR
2014-10-06T23:52:59  <cosmo> LISTEN TO MEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHEEHUEHUE
2014-10-06T23:54:21  <CoHe> Good night gents
2014-10-06T23:54:31  *** CoHe <CoHe!565670c0@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.86.86.112.192> has quit IRC (Quit: http://www.kiwiirc.com/ - A hand crafted IRC client)
2014-10-06T23:55:01  <samson_> He hasn't posted since September
2014-10-06T23:59:09  <cosmo> BCX doesn't care
2014-10-06T23:59:19  <cosmo> he'll post it anyway and try to make you look like an idiot
2014-10-06T23:59:38  <cosmo> the goal is to give him no potential ammo, and let him shine is natural idiocy in all its glory
2014-10-06T23:59:57  <cosmo> the post calling your a stupid shit is a good example
2014-10-07T00:00:02  <cosmo> meh
2014-10-07T00:00:13  <cosmo> more exposure for DGC is what this all amounts to
2014-10-07T00:00:40  <samson_> I give him all the credit he deserves : zero
2014-10-07T00:00:40  <cosmo> and he's making a ruckus over 560k being dumped, when near quintuple that has been traded on the markets recently
2014-10-07T00:01:06  <cosmo> lol
2014-10-07T00:01:07  <samson_> I've made my way back up to over 400k DGC and climbing steadily recently
2014-10-07T00:01:47  <cosmo> lets get the fundraiser going as soon as the clients ready for public testing
2014-10-07T00:02:16  <samson_> What do we need these fund for anyway ?
2014-10-07T00:02:51  <samson_> promotions ?
2014-10-07T00:03:06  <cosmo> attracting developers, promoters, artists, etc
2014-10-07T00:03:21  <samson_> Yeah, that's what I figured
2014-10-07T00:03:45  <cosmo> dunno how the pros/cons weigh against having a public address with 200k-1m dgc
2014-10-07T00:03:52  <cosmo> whether that'll attract more hate or what
2014-10-07T00:04:14  <samson_> I believe my coins are in several addresses
2014-10-07T00:04:25  <samson_> I would suggest others do the same
2014-10-07T00:07:51  <cosmo> we can do that
2014-10-07T00:09:03  <cosmo> mine are on exchanges :s i am a fine idiot
2014-10-07T00:09:21  <RunningmanZ> lol i have 60k dgc on Cryptsy. *joins the idiot club* :D
2014-10-07T00:10:49  <RunningmanZ> I need to get around to moving it
2014-10-07T00:11:42  <cosmo> i had 200k on paper wallets, then moved them on exchanges cuz i had a sudden loss of faith
2014-10-07T00:12:02  <cosmo> which has since regained; naturally i'm not the best with markets :3
2014-10-07T00:14:11  <ahmed_> hey all
2014-10-07T00:14:55  <samson_> I will be releasing soome simple paper wallet command line tools at some point in the future
2014-10-07T00:16:01  <cosmo> neato
2014-10-07T00:16:04  <cosmo> and heya ahmed_
2014-10-07T00:16:42  <ahmed_> hows it going?
2014-10-07T00:16:48  <samson_> WIF import key / address generation, no internet connection required at all - simple C programs using polarssl - I'd like to explore things like dice based key generation so you know nobody's meddling with your random numbers because you can create them yourself
2014-10-07T00:18:52  <samson_> was looking at hex dice, interesting concept
2014-10-07T00:18:53  <cosmo> isn't that's what's happening with the java paper-wallet thing?
2014-10-07T00:19:11  <cosmo> you move your mouse around like an epileptic and it uses those movements to generate the address
2014-10-07T00:19:20  <samson_> yes, via a webpage - I don't trust them
2014-10-07T00:19:31  <cosmo> yeah
2014-10-07T00:19:48  <cosmo> well ideally you download the html and use it on a fresh OS
2014-10-07T00:20:00  <cosmo> still from the net though.
2014-10-07T00:20:12  <cosmo> it's going alright ahmed_, how's school?
2014-10-07T00:21:17  <samson_> roll your own dice - make up some numbers, nobody could ever know them, take a random photo of hundreds of dice on a table and make an sha256 hash from it - that could be the key - there's all sorts of ways to do it 100% offline
2014-10-07T00:21:18  <ahmed_> cosmo: its going good. packing things ready for vegas tomorrow :)
2014-10-07T00:21:56  <cosmo> fun stuff
2014-10-07T00:22:00  <samson_> It's along flight to Vegas from the UK - I've done it a couple of times many years ago - I alway stopped off somewhere for a few days on the way - like NY / DC
2014-10-07T00:22:22  <ahmed_> yeah
2014-10-07T00:22:30  <cosmo> been to vegas once, not a fan
2014-10-07T00:22:36  <ahmed_> manchester -> philadelphia -> miami -> vegas
2014-10-07T00:22:54  <samson_> long route
2014-10-07T00:23:14  <ahmed_> yupp
2014-10-07T00:23:22  <ahmed_> was also pretty cheap too
2014-10-07T00:23:34  <ahmed_> < £500 each return
2014-10-07T00:23:36  <samson_> I went Heathrow -> DC -> Vegas -> Chicago once
2014-10-07T00:24:01  <ahmed_> nice
2014-10-07T00:24:17  <ahmed_> went to heathrow once to travel to morocco
2014-10-07T00:24:28  <samson_> Vegas was a stopoff on that trip - real destination was Chicago where I stayed about a week
2014-10-07T00:28:18  <ahmed_> mhmm
2014-10-07T00:28:20  <ahmed_> nice
2014-10-07T00:29:21  <samson_> back then it was fly to the US, one free stopoff in either direction - so take your pick
2014-10-07T00:29:31  <samson_> AA or United
2014-10-07T00:29:55  <samson_> Probably changed - haven't been to the US for at least 10 years now
2014-10-07T01:05:31  <kenel> everyone here?
2014-10-07T01:05:45  <kenel> actually

2014-10-07T01:49:10  <RunningmanZ> samson_: At least posts like that remind people of what a total fraud he is
2014-10-07T01:49:37  <RunningmanZ> What the fk is that Spoetnik on about. We have already said numerous times Baritus is not coming back. esp Kenel. He is retarded.
2014-10-07T01:50:14  <samson_> Yes, he's probably received requests from BCX to help him out
2014-10-07T01:55:00  <techbytes> wow samson, you finally got through to him... :)
2014-10-07T01:55:04  <samson_> maybe
2014-10-07T01:55:40  <techbytes> i believe it when i don't see any more of his post in dgc threads...
2014-10-07T01:56:41  <RunningmanZ> hahah samson i find it funny he is backing off now
2014-10-07T01:56:47  <RunningmanZ> since we posted those posts
2014-10-07T01:56:57  <RunningmanZ> I reckon that Danny Maddox stuff worries him
2014-10-07T01:57:04  <RunningmanZ> he backed off before when all that was happening
2014-10-07T01:57:50  <RunningmanZ> I believe he got in alot of trouble about that when ti all went down
2014-10-07T01:57:54  <RunningmanZ> it*
2014-10-07T01:58:22  <RunningmanZ> cops were called in etc
2014-10-07T01:58:52  <RunningmanZ> if you read that whole Danny Maddox stuff, unless he made that story up. Either way it seems to bother him
2014-10-07T02:05:45  <RunningmanZ> hahaha he locked the thread!!!

2014-10-07T02:07:46  <RunningmanZ> How can he lock the thread lol
2014-10-07T02:07:52  <RunningmanZ> must have asked a mod
2014-10-07T02:08:08  <samson_> He is a mod...
2014-10-07T02:08:13  <RunningmanZ> yeah
2014-10-07T02:08:19  <RunningmanZ> would explain alot
2014-10-07T02:08:46  <techbytes> if you created a thread, you can lock it.
2014-10-07T02:08:47  <RunningmanZ> ph well we know what buttons to push if he starts up again but hopefully he leaves us alone now
2014-10-07T02:08:53  <RunningmanZ> ah yeah
2014-10-07T02:09:07  <samson_> Posting that google earth link might have made a difference too
2014-10-07T02:09:13  <samson_> He PM'd me too
2014-10-07T02:09:19  <samson_> Said he'd appreciate a reply
2014-10-07T02:09:21  <samson_> I replied
2014-10-07T02:09:23  <samson_> Thread locked
2014-10-07T02:09:39  <samson_> And he didn't get what he wanted - it was made clear that we would never back down to his demands
2014-10-07T02:09:57  <samson_> Well I wouldn't anyway - never
2014-10-07T02:10:25  <samson_> No gloating in the forums !
2014-10-07T02:10:27  <RunningmanZ> yeah but he never backed down even when we said we wouldn't tell him
2014-10-07T02:10:37  <samson_> true
2014-10-07T02:10:53  <RunningmanZ> so i'm still thinking it had to do with the Danny Maddox stuff too. he ran for the hills last time all that came out years ago. Never repleid to finish that thread
2014-10-07T02:11:09  <samson_> yeah, could well be right
2014-10-07T02:11:52  <samson_> So lets forget about BCX for now but we should be very sure to make our security the best there is with contingency plans for attacks, etc
2014-10-07T02:12:07  <RunningmanZ> Either way nice work all. I never thought we could shut him up. Obviously it just takes the right bit of info.
2014-10-07T02:17:44  <cosmo> just when it was getting fun.. that was great PR for dgc
2014-10-07T02:22:49  <samson_> New PM from BCX :
2014-10-07T02:22:49  <samson_> I have removed most of post accusing Baritus of still being involved.
2014-10-07T02:22:49  <samson_> You should delete your responses, relaunch your fundraiser in a new SELF MODDED THREAD to which I will respond with a post stating I am confident now that baritus is gone.
2014-10-07T02:23:01  <samson_> I'm too tired now - I just posted it in #digitalcoin as well
2014-10-07T02:23:20  <samson_> He recommends self moderated threads as well though
2014-10-07T02:25:57  <cosmo> ignore him
2014-10-07T02:29:01  <kenel> he sent that to you and me only samson_
2014-10-07T02:29:31  <samson_> ok
2014-10-07T02:29:49  <kenel> want me to repost techbyte's thing?
2014-10-07T02:29:58  <samson_> Too late here to think about it - nearly finished my bottle of wine as well
2014-10-07T02:30:06  <samson_> Will revisit it tomorrow though
2014-10-07T02:30:32  <samson_> What was techbytes thing ?

2014-10-07T02:31:55  <kenel> k, good thinking

2014-10-07T02:33:07  <samson_> So how about some real discusssion on DGC 3.0
2014-10-07T02:33:07  <samson_> What will be better?
2014-10-07T02:33:11  <samson_> From BCX
2014-10-07T02:33:43  <kenel> the fuck
2014-10-07T02:33:54  <kenel> i'm so confused i feel like this is a bait and switch
2014-10-07T02:34:15  <samson_> Yes - I just hope someone doesn't use data storage as an attack vector - this is a really useful function and can add a lot of things but I think we need to think how it could be abused
2014-10-07T02:34:37  <samson_> There is still time to make more changes
2014-10-07T02:35:05  <RunningmanZ> lol if it was Wednesday it would be 'wacky Wednesday'
2014-10-07T02:35:14  <RunningmanZ> BCX turning like that
2014-10-07T02:35:51  <samson_> I think it would be good if we came up with a new additional proof of work that's not being used by anyone else and add that into the mix as well as the other algorithms
2014-10-07T02:36:13  <RunningmanZ> maybe he got struck by lightning had a near death experience and god told him to stop being an asshole
2014-10-07T02:36:14  <RunningmanZ> :D
2014-10-07T02:36:24  <kenel> i really wouldn't be opposed to that samson_ but that is honest to god way above my pay grade
2014-10-07T02:37:12  <kenel> POW that allows you to mine on your cell phone? :P
2014-10-07T02:37:17  <samson_> Yeah and it will take me some time to think about it - everyone uses basic hashing / mix / mashes of hashes - that's it - simple shit - it works at the moment
2014-10-07T02:37:32  <RunningmanZ> samson_:yeah you know some dickhead will fidn a way to screw around with the data storage so heave to be very careful as it could be a showstopper for us as in a BAD way
2014-10-07T02:37:50  <samson_> Maybe we should phase it in
2014-10-07T02:37:56  <kenel> how...
2014-10-07T02:38:08  <kenel> how could you turn the mining into some sort of a contest between people
2014-10-07T02:38:24  <kenel> like how folding ranks people or something
2014-10-07T02:38:25  <kenel> i don't know
2014-10-07T02:38:45  <samson_> Some more thinking wouldn't hurt though
2014-10-07T02:39:28  <vinje> new worm, stored exclusively in dgc blockchain ftw!  Iran's power goes out, NSA rejoices and blames it on silkroad, BTCXjackhole says "I told you so"
2014-10-07T02:39:45  <vinje> I should start my own internet rag paper :)
2014-10-07T02:40:19  <kenel> call it 'the bunion'
2014-10-07T02:40:35  <samson_> lol
2014-10-07T02:42:50  <vinje> I'd probably get sued by the Onion :P
2014-10-07T02:43:00  <vinje> which would be hilarious front page news
2014-10-07T02:43:13  <kenel> then make them come to aussie land, beat them in court, and make the judge give them the boot
2014-10-07T02:43:15  <kenel> just like in the simpsons
2014-10-07T02:43:24  <vinje> satire site sues over satire.  Millions think the word Satire looks odd.
2014-10-07T02:43:45  <vinje> oooh, the boot is bad.
2014-10-07T02:44:33  <kenel> wait, that's a real thing?
2014-10-07T02:45:04  <samson_> I think we should invent a new proof of work algorithm
2014-10-07T02:45:15  <samson_> completely new
2014-10-07T02:45:19  <samson_> non hash based
2014-10-07T02:45:29  <samson_> This would require new mining software
2014-10-07T02:45:44  <RunningmanZ> kenel:lol that simpons episode was so so dumb but hilarious
2014-10-07T02:45:47  <kenel> how long does that put off development of 3.0?
2014-10-07T02:45:53  <samson_> But all new hashing algorithms require new mining software mods
2014-10-07T02:45:54  <kenel> or would this be for 4.0 samson_ ?
2014-10-07T02:46:18  <vinje> And do we have the skill base to pull off something like that?
2014-10-07T02:46:27  <samson_> Does it take much skill ?
2014-10-07T02:46:37  <samson_> Hashing something is actually a very basic operation
2014-10-07T02:46:59  <vinje> yeah, I seen you can do it on paper :)
2014-10-07T02:47:26  <samson_> I wrote a small program to find a hash of some data with X amount of leading zeroes in about 30 minutes
2014-10-07T02:47:37  <samson_> it's just a looop comparing the result
2014-10-07T02:47:49  <samson_> Instead of using a hash something else that takes time could be used
2014-10-07T02:48:19  <samson_> Think of encryption algorithms - like decrypt a hash multiple times until a desired result is achieved
2014-10-07T02:48:49  <samson_> Or I mentioned create a public key from a hash then hash the public key and look for the leading zeroes in the end result of that
2014-10-07T02:48:56  <kenel> well...we could use it to crack bank codes of offshore accounts of famous people
2014-10-07T02:49:01  <kenel> then funnel it to you
2014-10-07T02:49:05  <kenel> then you dispurse it to us
2014-10-07T02:49:11  <samson_> There's a lot of ready made things that could be slotted in there in place of a hash function
2014-10-07T02:49:57  <kenel> you mean like something similar to what curecoin is doing?
2014-10-07T02:50:05  <kenel> using folding? or something entirely different?
2014-10-07T02:50:14  <samson_> There are onl so many hash functions - things like decryption and public key creation from pirvate keys which are actually just hashes would take time and prove work
2014-10-07T02:50:34  <kenel> hold on a second, i don't know if this is even possible
2014-10-07T02:50:38  <samson_> It's still simple operations using crypto primitives
2014-10-07T02:50:54  <kenel> but what if instead of decrypting things...the proof of work actually works to create an unhackable, evolving cryptography
2014-10-07T02:51:15  <kenel> or does that just sound stupid as hell?
2014-10-07T02:51:28  <samson_> I don't know what that means
2014-10-07T02:51:53  <samson_> But you wouldn't actually need to decrypt anything - it would just be a hash - run it through a decryption algorithm and look for a result with leading zeroes
2014-10-07T02:52:03  <kenel> see? above my pay grade
2014-10-07T02:52:30  <samson_> The proof would be finding the key which produces the most leading zeroes - and that's the block winner
2014-10-07T02:52:42  <kenel> i guess in simple terms...instead of solving problems with hash, you're creating problems
2014-10-07T02:52:47  <samson_> It requires hard work to find but very little work to verify
2014-10-07T02:52:49  <kenel> i'm sure that sounds stupid
2014-10-07T02:52:57  <kenel> don't know how to explain it :P
2014-10-07T02:53:06  <samson_> Yes, need to think a lot more
2014-10-07T02:53:32  <samson_> but with this conference coming up I have time to think and read / watch some of those crypto lectures from stanford, etc
2014-10-07T02:54:16  <samson_> ok so the BCX thread was not self moderated
2014-10-07T02:54:28  <samson_> but he's deleting posts there apparently - cosmo ?
2014-10-07T02:54:40  <samson_> How can he do that without it being self moderated ?
2014-10-07T02:57:19  <RunningmanZ> so he wants us to delete our reponses??
2014-10-07T02:57:57  <kenel> just a thought
2014-10-07T02:58:06  <kenel> are we the first coin he's actually done a 360 on?
2014-10-07T02:58:29  <samson_> I can delete my responses in that thread
2014-10-07T02:58:30  <RunningmanZ> not sure but its rare as hens teeth seeing this happen
2014-10-07T02:58:30  <RunningmanZ> lol
2014-10-07T02:58:50  <RunningmanZ> as i said we must have hit close to home on something
2014-10-07T02:58:51  <samson_> I presume it's the ones where I called him a cunt and reasoned with hi,
2014-10-07T02:59:01  <samson_> *him
2014-10-07T02:59:02  <RunningmanZ> because he never backed down much before if at all
2014-10-07T02:59:12  <samson_> It won't be until tomorrow though
2014-10-07T02:59:25  <samson_> Well maybe he does hate Baritus and not DGC
2014-10-07T02:59:35  <samson_> Personally I would prepare for an attack anyway
2014-10-07T02:59:54  <samson_> But make it hard for him
2014-10-07T03:00:05  <RunningmanZ> Lol I feel like I've entered the twilight zone https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=800481.msg9110499#msg9110499

2014-10-07T03:01:09  <samson_> Maybe we should ask him if he can suggest any improvements he would like to see ?
2014-10-07T03:01:33  <kenel> let me actually do that right now
2014-10-07T03:02:23  <samson_> Tell him we're working on various things which have been mentioned but are open to more positive ideas from anyone who wants to contribute

2014-10-07T03:03:55  <samson_> I do wonder why he had the change of heart. I would not back down even if my investment went to 1/100th of it's current value - I'd just buy more and get 100 times more for the same amount
2014-10-07T03:04:42  <kenel> in all honesty, i'm not sure
2014-10-07T03:04:48  <samson_> Eventually the coins would run out and then it goes up - I did this on SRC last year and made a bundle out of it
2014-10-07T03:05:07  <kenel> i had been PMing him reasoning with him and then while i was just exercising i see that
2014-10-07T03:05:11  <kenel> but who knows what it actually is
2014-10-07T03:06:01  <samson_> yes, things may have changed quite a bit over the last few hours, I'm glad I didn't have an early night
2014-10-07T03:07:12  <RunningmanZ> kenel:the only reason i see is that he is worried about something we said. he never backed down ever before no matter what we said in the past
2014-10-07T03:07:12  <samson_> I'll delete my posts from his thread
2014-10-07T03:07:26  <samson_> But before I do that I will make a copy of them all so I can use them again if needed
2014-10-07T03:07:38  <kenel> i'm not sure about that RunningmanZ ; i wouldn't attribute it to any one thing in particular
2014-10-07T03:07:41  <kenel> who knows
2014-10-07T03:08:19  <RunningmanZ> it would explain why he never continued that thread when he got nailed. Becuase it was the truth
2014-10-07T03:08:31  <RunningmanZ> anyway as long as he is off harassing us its good
2014-10-07T03:08:37  <kenel> i think you're thinking too much into it
2014-10-07T03:08:43  <kenel> usually the most simple answer is the right answer
2014-10-07T03:08:55  <RunningmanZ> he turned into a saint of his own accord?
2014-10-07T03:08:56  <RunningmanZ> :D
2014-10-07T03:09:15  <kenel> i think he holds a lot of dgc
2014-10-07T03:09:20  <RunningmanZ> oh im sure of it
2014-10-07T03:09:26  <RunningmanZ> he has been mining it for ages
2014-10-07T03:09:31  <RunningmanZ> even said so himself
2014-10-07T03:17:00  <samson_> I get the impression that he mines and holds
2014-10-07T03:17:14  <samson_> probably never sells anything - doesn't need to
2014-10-07T03:17:30  <samson_> made his money from BTC - the rest it 'just in case'
2014-10-07T03:17:44  <samson_> Me, I want to make DGC the just in case scenario
2014-10-07T03:20:06  <RunningmanZ> I think he made a shitload from fudding LTC ages ago
2014-10-07T03:20:45  <RunningmanZ> ltc was at $40 at one stage and I think he had hundreds of thousands of them
2014-10-07T03:26:39  <kenel> look, if we can get through this stage in the game, and keep what we have going....there's nothing stopping us from doing the same thing
2014-10-07T03:26:54  <kenel> we took a tailspinning plane wreck and figured out how to fly it on one engine
2014-10-07T03:27:26  <samson_> Never back down
2014-10-07T03:28:29  <samson_> Sometimes I might go a bit over the top but it's raw thoughts out of the cortex down the arms, through the fingers and out into the wildernesss
2014-10-07T03:29:16  <kenel> all we need is a few good engineers to fix the damn engines without landing and we'll be back in the mile high club :)
2014-10-07T03:31:10  <techbytes> rz, i think it was the baritus=bcx comment that did him in...  :)
2014-10-07T03:31:28  <samson_> really ?
2014-10-07T03:31:47  <techbytes> i'm just speculating...
2014-10-07T03:31:56  <techbytes> who knows..
2014-10-07T03:32:00  <samson_> I was going to allude to that weeks ago
2014-10-07T03:32:04  <samson_> who knows
2014-10-07T03:32:09  <samson_> exactly
2014-10-07T03:32:36  <samson_> he probably couldn't prove he isn't Baritus
2014-10-07T03:32:55  <samson_> proving a negative is notoriously difficult
2014-10-07T03:33:54  <samson_> sleep time, later
2014-10-07T04:06:57  <RunningmanZ> i dunno i don't buy that whole Baritus = BCX theory unless he has multiple personality disorder
2014-10-07T04:06:58  <RunningmanZ> lol
2014-10-07T04:10:37  <RunningmanZ> the other thing is the mods might not want any heat on the BCT site again like what possibly happened with that whole Danny Maddox thing if the police etc were involved so maybe they told him to pull his head in. I dunno
2014-10-07T04:16:33  <vinje> I upgraded to Windows 95 ONLY because I could have more than 1 internet window open at once, and play a schizo on chathouse.com
2014-10-07T04:16:58  <vinje> 4 of me in a room arguing and stiring up shit with myself just to see who would take my/my/my/his side
2014-10-07T04:28:31  <vinje> heh, he's deleted my posts too
2014-10-07T04:47:56  <RunningmanZ> lol
2014-10-07T04:53:08  <vinje> yet another reason that place is suspect as fk.  And why he insists we have a presence there.

2014-10-07T12:17:40  <CoHe> Wolf you are form the US right?
2014-10-07T12:18:00  <CoHe> Is there a way for you guys to directly exchange DGC to USD?
2014-10-07T12:22:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Course not.
2014-10-07T12:22:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> BTC is the gateway for pretty much everything
2014-10-07T12:23:37  <CoHe> I knew it but needed see it confirmed
2014-10-07T12:26:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Why?
2014-10-07T12:27:00  <CoHe> Am busy with a little side project
2014-10-07T12:27:14  <CoHe> Its built on that premis
2014-10-07T12:27:24  <CoHe> Hoping to show you guys soon
2014-10-07T12:27:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Sounds good
2014-10-07T12:28:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Now can we hurry up and switch algos?
2014-10-07T12:28:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I wanna mine some.
2014-10-07T12:28:45  <CoHe> ;)
2014-10-07T12:28:49  <CoHe> cards doing good?
2014-10-07T12:30:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> CoHe: Yeah - considering attempting to get the best hash/watt ratio by undervolting and playing with clocks.
2014-10-07T12:31:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Hehe, every time I look at my temps, I just laugh and shake my head.
2014-10-07T12:31:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That 280X is mining full out at 50C
2014-10-07T12:32:16  <CoHe> Wolf I needed that confirmed form an american you mind if i copy your reply?
2014-10-07T12:32:23  <CoHe> from*'
2014-10-07T12:32:31  <CoHe> Is pretty important
2014-10-07T12:32:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> As long as you add that I'm no expert - I haven't found any, but that does not necessarily mean none exist.
2014-10-07T12:33:09  <CoHe> Nah there is non..they are just being hard asses with me
2014-10-07T12:33:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Just in case you're trying to sell some investor on your project with some shit like, "Yeah, I have a reliable source in the US saying you can't do it there." :P
2014-10-07T12:33:49  <CoHe> Hahahahaha
2014-10-07T12:34:24  <CoHe> Thats was some crystalclear insight if I ever saw onr
2014-10-07T12:34:33  <CoHe> one*
2014-10-07T12:34:59  <CoHe> I also did my research and will just say i double checked
2014-10-07T12:35:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Haha, I suspected; don't want it to be my ass if one suddenly shows up lol
2014-10-07T12:35:24  <CoHe> Will be my ass
2014-10-07T12:35:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> all right; go ahead

2014-10-07T12:52:28  <RunningmanZ> evening guys
2014-10-07T12:57:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Morning, RunningmanZ
2014-10-07T13:03:01  <samson_> hey
2014-10-07T13:03:54  <RunningmanZ> hey Wolf|WinLaptop samson_
2014-10-07T13:08:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> RunningmanZ: So...
2014-10-07T13:08:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I really wish sometimes I could just let bullshit fly
2014-10-07T13:08:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but today, I signed up on yet another coin forum :P
2014-10-07T13:09:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Some dipshit was talking about how he's done optimizations to X11, and believes my predictions are BS, saying he "highly doubts" that X11 could be improved even another 40%
2014-10-07T13:09:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I HAVE *in hand* 34.34% on it over most relevant AMD GPUs.
2014-10-07T13:10:33  <RunningmanZ> hehe yeah some people can be annoying like that
2014-10-07T13:12:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> RunningmanZ: Thing is - he probably believes it
2014-10-07T13:12:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> because he sucks lol
2014-10-07T13:13:15  <samson_> X11 is a whole bunch of hashes, I'm sure some of them haven't previously been optimised in any way, some of them I've never even heard of before - did they get further than reference implementations ?
2014-10-07T13:13:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> They didn't USE the ref impl
2014-10-07T13:13:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they used PHM's code
2014-10-07T13:13:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> from sph-sgminer
2014-10-07T13:14:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and it's basically just an asston of macros meant for CPU
2014-10-07T13:14:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> that have been shoehorned into opencl and tweaked until the syntax was right
2014-10-07T13:14:17  <RunningmanZ> lol @ that dude falling over while ice skating and trying to sing the national anthem in Canada hehe
2014-10-07T13:14:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Most of these hash algos can be not only optimized
2014-10-07T13:15:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> you can fucking rewrite and re-structure them to be insansely faster on GPU, samson_
2014-10-07T13:15:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The ONLY one that they seem to have gotten just about optimal is Shavite
2014-10-07T13:16:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It can go 4-way, but since it uses registers SO OFTEN, and a tiny amount of calculation is necessary to access local memory, the calculations being done so often soon cancels out the benefit of running 4-way
2014-10-07T13:16:51  <samson_> That's what I mean - these algorithms are dreamed up by academics and left as reference implementations for years
2014-10-07T13:17:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so, the optimal structure of Shavite3 for GPU is also the simplest - a monolithic unrolled loop
2014-10-07T13:17:58  <RunningmanZ> So BCX hasn't provided any positive input yet lol
2014-10-07T13:18:06  <RunningmanZ> in the DGC thread
2014-10-07T13:18:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Therefore, although PHM's code is hard to read, it's just about optimal.
2014-10-07T13:18:17  <samson_> No, but he's stopped wth the negative input
2014-10-07T13:18:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and samson_, it's not like these are ref implementations
2014-10-07T13:18:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they're optimized ones
2014-10-07T13:18:32  <Wolf|WinLaptop> FOR CPU
2014-10-07T13:19:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The issue is, these guys don't know their asshole from their elbow when it comes to GPUs, and so the shit they come up with isn't even a proper port
2014-10-07T13:19:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> let alone optimized
2014-10-07T13:19:23  <samson_> Ah I see, so a rewrite for GP Uwill make all the difference
2014-10-07T13:19:48  <samson_> I've never done any GPU programming
2014-10-07T13:20:41  <samson_> BCX asked me to delete some posts which quoted posts of his which he had deleted
2014-10-07T13:21:05  <samson_> Posts where ha says he believes Baritus is in charge of the DGC Foundation but I couldn't find and quotes to his deleted posts
2014-10-07T13:21:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: for example, CPUs usually have 4 to 8 cores
2014-10-07T13:21:51  <samson_> There are plenty of posts which I quote him but the originals are still there - I've messaged him with a list of his posts which I've quoted asking for clarification
2014-10-07T13:21:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> splitting a hash 4-way, 8-way, 16-way - that's a pretty hard optimization, usually for low gain on a CPU
2014-10-07T13:22:12  <samson_> How many cores in these GPU's though ?
2014-10-07T13:22:24  <samson_> There's a lot more than that isn't there
2014-10-07T13:22:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but GPUs are designed from the ground up for parallel execution - for various reasons, they perform EXTREMELY well when the workload is small, simple, and there's a lot of it. 290X has 2816
2014-10-07T13:23:22  <samson_> Yeah, big difference right there
2014-10-07T13:23:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Now - SIMD is fucking massive and complex, while most hash algs are simple
2014-10-07T13:24:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Having an implementation of SIMD completely unrolled and using one thread per hash...
2014-10-07T13:24:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> A GPU is having none of that shit.
2014-10-07T13:25:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> SIMD is actually the main reason X11 is so goddamned slow - not only should it be run 8-way or even 16-way, it should be implemented using at least two, probably three, kernels.
2014-10-07T13:26:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Echo was horribly done - I suspect they wasted 16 registers per hash by storing constants in them - this is bad because GPUs run many threads on a multiprocessor, and that MP has a set number of registers. The more you use, the less threads can be run on it in parallel - and if you don't have enough, then it uses the 500x slower global memory instead
2014-10-07T13:26:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I haven't even done an 8-way Echo yet lol
2014-10-07T13:26:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I just used a better one-way implementation
2014-10-07T13:27:00  <RunningmanZ> samson_:this is freakin cool on the rift. Gonna have another go now :D http://www.outerra.com/wgallery.html

2014-10-07T13:27:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and boom
2014-10-07T13:27:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> +20% or so
2014-10-07T13:27:40  <RunningmanZ> "3D planetary engine for seamless planet rendering from space down to the surface. Can use arbitrary resolution of elevation data, refining it to centimeter resolution using fractal algorithms."
2014-10-07T13:27:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And that's 20% gain on ALL of X11, samson_
2014-10-07T13:28:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Echo must have been like 5x'd lol
2014-10-07T13:28:03  <samson_> wow, pretty cool
2014-10-07T13:28:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Generally - you want to keep shit in registers of LDS (local memory, which is shared by a workgroup and on-chip)
2014-10-07T13:28:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *or
2014-10-07T13:29:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> because if you're going out to global memory often, your shit just got fuck slow
2014-10-07T13:29:56  <samson_> So you're really into the GPU programming then ?
2014-10-07T13:30:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Global memory pretty much should be used for storage of very large data, and getting work. That's about the fuck it.
2014-10-07T13:30:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And yeah - although I've been doing it for maybe 4 months
2014-10-07T13:30:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and still find these guys sad.
2014-10-07T13:31:18  <samson_> Do you happen to know if the private key to public key bignum point multiplication has been implemented in GPU - can it be done, is it possible ?
2014-10-07T13:32:54  <samson_> I know they have asics which work with EC so I'm guessing it's possible, I just wonder what kind of speeds are possible - I view these as poof of work schemes which could replace or at least supplement basic hashing
2014-10-07T13:33:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Has it been done, as in, is there public code for it? Dunno. Can it be done? Of course - pretty much anything you can do on CPU, you can on GPU
2014-10-07T13:33:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Is it gonna be a dog on GPUs? Dunno, I'm not intimately familiar with the operations used, but I'd guess not - might be a bit of a dog on AMD, but Nvidia should kill it.
2014-10-07T13:34:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I've done bignum multiplies on GPU
2014-10-07T13:34:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Not EC point ones, though
2014-10-07T13:34:58  <samson_> It's EEC Point multiplication
2014-10-07T13:35:08  <samson_> yes, that's the complex bit
2014-10-07T13:35:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and it requires an asston of multiplies, to the surprise of absolutely no one
2014-10-07T13:35:20  <samson_> I don't know how much it can be parallelised
2014-10-07T13:35:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but what you do is
2014-10-07T13:36:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> you use 64-bit muls and some adds to get you a 128 or 256-bit or whatever bit mul you want
2014-10-07T13:36:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> which could be parallelized, but for XCN I just said fuck it - speedup probably wouldn't have been worth it compared to a single threaded one
2014-10-07T13:37:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Why would AMD likely be a dog? Well, I think the only hardware multiplier they have is 24-bit, and they use that to emulate 32-bit and 64-bit multiplies
2014-10-07T13:37:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> while Nvidia has a full 32-bit multiplier and only has to emulate 64-bit ones
2014-10-07T13:38:08  <kenel-work2> what's the scientific equation for an asston?
2014-10-07T13:39:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel-work2: depends on what was being described - I know I said it, what was it in reference to?
2014-10-07T13:39:25  <kenel-work2> A = B^32 - W(S8/(C - D))
2014-10-07T13:39:33  <samson_> Interesting as previously Nvidia were the slower cards which nobody wanted, it was all AMD
2014-10-07T13:39:48  <kenel-work2> right equation is for figuring out buns, A = anaconda....if buns < 0, anaconda don't want none
2014-10-07T13:40:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: That's because first, Nvidia devs weren't really around, and second, most of the algorithms people were mining weren't actually memory hard - and none were heavy on multiplication.
2014-10-07T13:40:47  <kenel-work2> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JphDdGV2TU
2014-10-07T13:41:06  <samson_> I see
2014-10-07T13:41:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel-work2: If I was saying X11 can be improved an asston, I'm guessing 400% over current public
2014-10-07T13:41:11  <kenel-work2> in response to: <Wolf|WinLaptop>and it requires an asston of multiplies, to the surprise of absolutely no one
2014-10-07T13:41:32  <kenel-work2> still, no buns, no anaconda :)
2014-10-07T13:43:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel-work2: Well, in that case, the number of multiplies required depends on the size of the multiply you can do atomically
2014-10-07T13:43:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I think it's 4 multiplies for a 64-bit wide multiply if all you've got is 32-bit muls to work with
2014-10-07T13:43:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Three if you use Karatsuba
2014-10-07T13:43:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Karatsuba is nice because while it requires more adds, and I think maybe a subtraction
2014-10-07T13:43:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it allows you to omit one multiply that is necessary in the naive version
2014-10-07T13:44:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Multiplies are slow.
2014-10-07T13:44:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Divides are ouch slow.
2014-10-07T13:45:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Adds and subtracts are quick-ish
2014-10-07T13:45:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and shifts are usually one cycle
2014-10-07T13:45:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> aka instant
2014-10-07T13:45:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> this applies to CPUs, GPUs, toasters...
2014-10-07T13:46:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Therefore, if multiplying by a power of two, or dividing by one
2014-10-07T13:46:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> shift. Always
2014-10-07T13:46:51  <samson_> yeah, I've seen that in C
2014-10-07T13:47:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Modulus implies a division, if done by a power of two, use AND with that power of 2 minus one
2014-10-07T13:47:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> same result (unless you're working with signed integers, and that's pretty much never done in hashing)
2014-10-07T13:49:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So yeah - binary operations are almost always fast, use them if you can
2014-10-07T13:49:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> although on some weird shit
2014-10-07T13:49:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I once used an add instead of an or on an AMD GPU and it got a little faster
2014-10-07T13:49:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> odd.

2014-10-07T23:37:36  <RunningmanZ> cosmo:hey hey
2014-10-08T00:57:23  <RunningmanZ> Got a reply from that mod again about when I requested to lock that BCX troll thread. This just proves that BCX is a law unto himself. At least he is off our back tho. Those mods are deluded.
2014-10-08T00:57:47  <RunningmanZ> Mods description of the BCX thread -> "It's well worded, seems pretty substantial and definitely seems far from nonsense. Doesn't seem like trolling. It might be false, although that's not obvious. Sorry, but the fact that you don't like it, doesn't mean it's trolling."
2014-10-08T00:58:15  <RunningmanZ> What a load of horseshit
2014-10-08T01:08:05  <cosmo> well, bcx admitted to deleting other peoples posts too

2014-10-08T01:22:09  <kenel> actually RunningmanZ i think that's a pretty straightforward answer from them considering their policy on 'troll threads'
2014-10-08T01:22:32  <kenel> if it was something like 'baritus gives blumpkins to vinje while visiting aussieland' and had a picture of it
2014-10-08T01:22:36  <kenel> that'd be a different story
2014-10-08T01:27:42  <cosmo> well i got proof that bcx deletes post that aren't his
2014-10-08T01:28:02  <vinje> yeah me too.
2014-10-08T01:28:14  <vinje> I hit refresh and my post was gone.  :P
2014-10-08T01:28:22  <cosmo> in what thread?
2014-10-08T01:28:34  <vinje> The same thread everyone was talking in
2014-10-08T01:28:42  <kenel> vinje's not denying getting a blumpkin
2014-10-08T01:28:44  <vinje> It wasn't even agro.
2014-10-08T01:28:45  <kenel> that's the important thing here
2014-10-08T01:28:45  <cosmo> oh yeah, was that the mini rant you had against him
2014-10-08T01:28:53  <cosmo> calling him a dick and all that
2014-10-08T01:29:02  <cosmo> don't happen to have a screenie of it do ya
2014-10-08T01:29:04  <vinje> just a If you go to paris, there is a glass floor, maybe don't take anyone from this thread due to thrown rocks
2014-10-08T01:29:20  <vinje> no, I didn't check that post :)
2014-10-08T01:30:41  <RunningmanZ> kenel:Why does BCX need to post multiple threads about it under various gusies tho. he made his point ages ago. To me that constitutes trolling and is borderline spamming.
2014-10-08T01:30:41  <vinje> but I posted it, red someone else post after mine, F5 20min later and just see the chopped up remainder.
2014-10-08T01:30:47  <RunningmanZ> guises*
2014-10-08T01:31:19  <vinje> Rz, give it up.  He's got mod powers there.  You aren't going to change anything.  You'll just blow a gasket and die.
2014-10-08T01:31:38  <RunningmanZ> Yeah I have I told the mod we would agree to disagree lol
2014-10-08T01:31:55  <vinje> and they rolled their eyes, and went back to watching rainbow pr0n
2014-10-08T01:32:34  <vinje> fn bronies
2014-10-08T01:32:38  <RunningmanZ> Was worth a shot but I guess when BCX runs the show ynot much chance you will get anywhere with them
2014-10-08T01:33:40  <RunningmanZ> lol rainbow pr0n
2014-10-08T01:33:40  <RunningmanZ> dafuq is dat?
2014-10-08T01:33:40  <RunningmanZ> :D
2014-10-08T01:33:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Proving BCX is a liar isn't going to fly anywhere he can censor it
2014-10-08T01:33:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> RunningmanZ: You don't wanna know.
2014-10-08T01:34:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Just trust me.
2014-10-08T01:34:03  <kenel> vinje, i've seen more ponies episodes than i care to admit
2014-10-08T01:34:03  <kenel> i'll be glad when that shit is off netflix
2014-10-08T01:34:04  <kenel> kind of...
2014-10-08T01:34:04  <kenel> my daughter is OBSESSED
2014-10-08T01:34:04  <kenel> has seen every episode 3x already and this is 4x now
2014-10-08T01:34:06  <cosmo> he can't censor PM's
2014-10-08T01:34:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: So? PMs are seen by one person - the only use for them here is to notify mods, who couldn't give a fuck less.
2014-10-08T01:35:48  <RunningmanZ> kenel:Wait till your daughter gets addicted to Dance Moms. Thats worse
2014-10-08T01:35:58  <kenel> wtf is that?
2014-10-08T01:36:00  <RunningmanZ> Listening to that fatass dance teacher scream all day long

2014-10-08T15:59:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Spent a fuckton of time writing CubeHash the long way to figure it the fuck out
2014-10-08T15:59:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Was SO GODDAMNED TEDIOS
2014-10-08T15:59:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *TEDIOUS
2014-10-08T15:59:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then I replaced all that shit with a couple loops and some thought
2014-10-08T15:59:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> all of it has patterms
2014-10-08T15:59:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *patterns
2014-10-08T15:59:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> a little difficult to see sometimes
2014-10-08T16:00:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but pretty much all parts of both even and odd rounds can be looped
2014-10-08T16:00:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> letting the compiler do pretty much the only thing it does well: unroll them

2014-10-08T18:39:38  <kenel-work> probably going to just put them in my PCs and use for whatever ;\
2014-10-08T18:39:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Fucked with CubeHash, but it was only slightly better than stock until I manually unrolled the loops properly.

2014-10-09T18:35:45  <samson_> Who's running the forum ?
2014-10-09T18:37:36  <samson_> I heard that the baritus user has it's email set to admin@digitalcoin.co - the message is :
2014-10-09T18:37:39  <samson_> Can you please have whoever is in control of the forums set my account email to admin@cryptoave.com so that I may post updates. It is currently admin@digitalcoin.co, which I no longer have access to for account recovery.

2014-10-09T21:49:00  <cosmo> convenience store
2014-10-09T21:49:03  <Rawdawg-1> ohh
2014-10-09T21:50:01  <Wolf`> hey, Rawdawg-1
2014-10-09T21:50:02  <cosmo> is your trading firm gonna be crypto only?
2014-10-09T21:50:11  <Wolf`> They invited me here for god knows what reason
2014-10-09T21:50:12  <Rawdawg-1> yea cosmo
2014-10-09T21:50:15  <Rawdawg-1> hey Wolf`
2014-10-09T21:50:17  <Rawdawg-1> whats up man
2014-10-09T21:50:47  <cosmo> neat
2014-10-09T21:50:51  <Wolf`> Not much - vectorized Skein; it looked like it'd be nearly ideal for it, but it wasn't; it got ugly fast.
2014-10-09T21:50:58  <Wolf`> Still works and is faster
2014-10-09T21:51:01  <Wolf`> just not by much
2014-10-09T21:51:05  <Rawdawg-1> thats good
2014-10-09T21:51:10  <Rawdawg-1> any improvements are good
2014-10-09T21:51:45  <Wolf`> IMO. on the order of 0.05 - 0.075MH/s X11 for like two hours' work sucks :P
2014-10-09T21:52:15  <Rawdawg-1> where are you from Wolf`?
2014-10-09T21:52:51  <Wolf`> Rawdawg-1: USA
2014-10-09T21:52:59  <Rawdawg-1> cool cool
2014-10-09T21:53:10  <Rawdawg-1> i might be able to use you on my dev team if you are interested
2014-10-09T21:53:24  <Wolf`> Rawdawg-1: so, why'd they invite me? And what would it be doing?
2014-10-09T21:53:25  <Rawdawg-1> details will come next weekish when i get settled in toronto
2014-10-09T21:53:57  <Rawdawg-1> oh im not sure right now, im a bit out of the loop, been dealing with some personal stuff
2014-10-09T21:54:08  <Rawdawg-1> kenel should be able to answer that though once he is around
2014-10-09T21:57:59  <cosmo> cuz you're not a turd wolf :p
2014-10-09T21:58:20  <cosmo> motivated, knowledge in the field we're working in, etc
2014-10-09T21:59:09  <cosmo> i think the foremost prerequisite is geunine belief that digitalcoin can become a brand name crypto
2014-10-09T22:00:19  <cosmo> we should probably be spamming more
2014-10-09T22:00:49  <Wolf`> cosmo: I'm just not shit.
2014-10-09T22:01:04  <Wolf`> That makes me a good dev? :P
2014-10-09T22:02:29  <Wolf`> I mean, I'm decent, don't get me wrong, but just because someone doesn't copy and paste CPU code and call it GPU code, knows how the platform he's coding for actually works, and doesn't waste cycles like they're free doesn't /technically/ make him good
2014-10-09T22:02:56  <cosmo> ya know
2014-10-09T22:03:10  <cosmo> the only reason the world doesn't run well, is because people short sell themselves
2014-10-09T22:04:00  <Wolf`> cosmo: I would think it's more because of the idiots
2014-10-09T22:04:18  <Wolf`> I AM only decent - I've been doing GPU coding for less than four months
2014-10-09T22:04:36  <Wolf`> and in less than a week of work, I got X11 35% higher or so without even trying
2014-10-09T22:04:49  <Wolf`> I'm not God - these people just suck :P
2014-10-09T22:04:54  <cosmo> well keep it up and in four months you'll be better, give up on yourself at any time and you can kiss that goodbye
2014-10-09T22:05:03  <Wolf`> lol give up?
2014-10-09T22:05:06  <Wolf`> Hell no.
2014-10-09T22:05:08  <cosmo> enter the supramundane!
2014-10-09T22:05:21  <Wolf`> I'm going to keep doing it and getting better
2014-10-09T22:05:51  <Wolf`> just because I'm better than the bottom-of-the-barrel people who made the X11 kernel doesn't mean I should sit back and think I'm awesome :P
2014-10-09T22:06:16  <cosmo> of course not, but doesn't mean you should say you're worth shit
2014-10-09T22:06:19  <cosmo> either.

2014-10-09T22:07:37  <Wolf`> cosmo: lol, I didn't say I'm worth shit
2014-10-09T22:07:41  <Wolf`> I said I wasn't *good*
2014-10-09T22:07:44  <Wolf`> I'm just all right
2014-10-09T22:07:51  <Wolf`> At CPU dev, yeah, I am good.
2014-10-09T22:08:22  <cosmo> ah well..
2014-10-09T22:08:53  <cosmo> wouldn't say you're wrong in being disappointed with humanity
2014-10-09T22:09:24  <cosmo> most people think there's a big shiny utopia waiting for us
2014-10-09T22:09:30  <Wolf`> lol, true
2014-10-09T22:09:52  <Wolf`> All I want from this world, is when I die, I want to be happy how my life turned out
2014-10-09T22:10:07  <Wolf`> Most people want to cheat death some way - religion, or leaving their mark on the world
2014-10-09T22:10:37  <Wolf`> but religion is bullshit and as for leaving your mark or being remembered, long term, the human race is probably dead.
2014-10-09T22:10:53  <Wolf`> Therefore, you don't matter and nothing you do will matter
2014-10-09T22:10:57  <Wolf`> So enjoy life.

2014-10-09T22:12:34  <cosmo> lol
2014-10-09T22:13:21  <cosmo> basically yeah the suns gonna explode or whatever the hell and life as we know it will be extinguished
2014-10-09T22:13:45  <Wolf`> Again
2014-10-09T22:13:58  <Wolf`> Been plenty of mass extinctions on Earth as far as we know
2014-10-09T22:14:05  <Wolf`> Probably gonna be plenty more.
2014-10-09T22:14:40  <cosmo> yeah
2014-10-09T22:15:31  <cosmo> all i want from this world is the ability to vomit at will
2014-10-09T22:15:38  <cosmo> would be a great punctuation to most conversations
2014-10-09T22:19:05  <cosmo> that and a house
2014-10-09T22:19:05  <Wolf`> lol
2014-10-09T22:19:35  <Wolf`> cosmo: You're too much like me :P
2014-10-09T22:20:03  <cosmo> :D friendship through space and time!
2014-10-09T22:21:14  <cosmo> pretty convinced i've got a good idea on enlightenment
2014-10-09T22:21:29  <cosmo> but mindfulness doesn't pay bills
2014-10-09T22:21:40  <cosmo> and most people don't want to put the effort into sacrifice
2014-10-09T22:21:45  <cosmo> mmmm idk
2014-10-09T22:21:57  <cosmo> if i were a landlord i could at least boss other people around for a living, that'd be nice

2014-10-09T22:22:25  <cosmo> sucks to sit behind a register telling people to 'have a nice day' when it's their obsessive need for pleasure that's degrading society
2014-10-09T22:23:28  <techbytes> no cosmo, your tenants will nag the crap out of you...
2014-10-09T22:24:20  <cosmo> pretty sure i could find some people that'd be decent, but yeah
2014-10-09T22:24:30  <Wolf`> cosmo: Being enlightened does pay bills
2014-10-09T22:24:32  <cosmo> if you're not on your shit legal wise they can drag things out and soak your money
2014-10-09T22:24:35  <Wolf`> well, it helps
2014-10-09T22:24:59  <cosmo> oh yeah, it helps you deal with bullshit which is everything
2014-10-09T22:25:10  <Wolf`> because then you realize most people are shit, and will stab you for the change in your pockets
2014-10-09T22:25:17  <cosmo> i'm kinda a bitch but i'm just wrought over this shit that i can't focus on anything else
2014-10-09T22:25:40  <cosmo> like, i'm not making money because i'm simply not motivated to make money
2014-10-09T22:25:49  <cosmo> just motivated at being patient with people
2014-10-09T22:25:51  <Wolf`> cosmo: It took me a while to accept what I saw in humanity. Oh, that?
2014-10-09T22:26:01  <Wolf`> Dextroamphetamine.
2014-10-09T22:26:11  <cosmo> but yeah it's very true every person works towards their own desires
2014-10-09T22:26:17  <cosmo> even parents to their kids
2014-10-09T22:27:06  <cosmo> i'm tellin ya try methoxetamine
2014-10-09T22:27:22  <cosmo> although it's not really a clear headspace
2014-10-09T22:27:24  <Wolf`> cosmo: I'm prescribed dex - besides, it's fantastic
2014-10-09T22:27:36  <Wolf`> Motivating, and it helps you see things clear
2014-10-09T22:27:37  <cosmo> i'd try it
2014-10-09T22:27:54  <cosmo> i've got a tab of acid i've been saving for like a year
2014-10-09T22:27:58  <cosmo> worried it's losing potency
2014-10-09T22:28:39  <cosmo> i've got some powdered mushrooms too, but those are just terrifying
2014-10-09T22:28:40  <Wolf`> cosmo: I'm not into hallucinogens
2014-10-09T22:29:01  <Wolf`> I want to see clearer, not see things that aren't there
2014-10-09T22:29:17  <cosmo> lol, isn't dex hallicinogenic? felt like that when i chugged tussin once
2014-10-09T22:29:24  <cosmo> eh..
2014-10-09T22:29:27  <cosmo> drugs are drugs man.
2014-10-09T22:29:42  <cosmo> Acid's been the clearest thing for me, if you've never tried it you should.

2014-10-09T22:30:14  <cosmo> i don't think i've hallucinated on lsd.. more like letting go the notions i clung to, and literally saw things differently.
2014-10-09T22:30:33  <cosmo> just seeing things i've never acknowledged otherwise.
2014-10-09T22:33:13  <cosmo> release your inhibitions FEEL THE RAIN ON YOURR SKIN NOONE ELSE CAN FEEL IT FORR YA ONLY YOU CAN TAKE IT IN
2014-10-09T22:33:36  <Wolf`> cosmo: Drugs are NOT all the same
2014-10-09T22:34:00  <Wolf`> Amph makes me clearer and focused - narcotics get me stoned
2014-10-09T22:34:09  <Wolf`> there's one hell of a difference
2014-10-09T22:34:37  <cosmo> i'm not saying that, i've done my fair share
2014-10-09T22:34:54  <cosmo> but they all take you away from the main trip that is sobriety
2014-10-09T22:35:18  <cosmo> easy for me to say i guess
2014-10-09T22:35:21  <Wolf`> cosmo: hm...
2014-10-09T22:35:28  <Wolf`> well, since I'm ADD
2014-10-09T22:35:34  <Wolf`> and prescribed amph for a reason
2014-10-09T22:35:39  <Wolf`> sobriety kinda sucks
2014-10-09T22:35:43  <Wolf`> I stay on dex
2014-10-09T22:36:07  <CoHe> Good night gents
2014-10-09T22:36:17  <cosmo> see ya CoHe
2014-10-09T22:36:18  *** CoHe <CoHe!565670c0@gateway/web/cgi-irc/kiwiirc.com/ip.86.86.112.192> has quit IRC (Quit: http://www.kiwiirc.com/ - A hand crafted IRC client)
2014-10-09T22:36:36  <cosmo> whatever floats ya boat man
2014-10-09T22:36:43  <cosmo> i'm okay being sober, i don't really have a choice
2014-10-09T22:37:03  <cosmo> and thankfully my dad's crazy and is okay with me doing nothing
2014-10-09T22:38:01  <Wolf`> cosmo: luuucky
2014-10-09T22:38:16  <cosmo> after gaining experience in the world i understand why he's like that and feel it's my duty to repay him with the kindness he could never show me
2014-10-09T22:38:37  <Wolf`> I do amph and it helps me code to make money, which, in turn, gets me more amph when my prescription runs out for the month :P
2014-10-09T22:39:03  <cosmo> you should find raves or something and take your stress out there
2014-10-09T22:39:09  <cosmo> start one
2014-10-09T22:39:19  <cosmo> save money on drugs, put it into a retirement fund of some kind
2014-10-09T22:39:35  <Wolf`> No, I don't need it for stress
2014-10-09T22:39:39  <Wolf`> I need it to think
2014-10-09T22:39:44  <Wolf`> To code like I do
2014-10-09T22:40:21  <cosmo> i'd say otherwise, but if we're gonna start a fight i'd wanna be in the same room as you so we could hit each other
2014-10-09T22:41:10  <Wolf`> lol, I don't fight over differences of opinion - it's just an argument, and if we have to agree to disagree, so be it
2014-10-09T22:41:35  <Wolf`> I have mental issues that amph helps with, therefore, I need it to do what I do
2014-10-09T22:42:25  <cosmo> yeah, being nice to people isn't gonna gain you shelte/food
2014-10-09T22:43:21  <cosmo> i believe it's possible to overcome anything, but it's not gonna be a profitable endeavor that's for sure
2014-10-09T22:44:04  <cosmo> there's just suffering and the cessation of suffering
2014-10-09T22:44:37  <cosmo> and a mundane existence to boot.
2014-10-09T22:46:42  <cosmo> i should get back into tabletop rpgs
2014-10-09T22:52:17  <Wolf`> cosmo: Live to make yourself happy; cause it's not like anything matters LD

2014-10-09T23:17:39  <RunningmanZ> hey guys
2014-10-09T23:24:32  <Wolf`> That is a fuck of a lot of X11 hash :D

2014-10-09T23:48:47  <cosmo> whatdja listen to?
2014-10-09T23:49:06  <Rawdawg-1> amazon audiobook
2014-10-09T23:49:19  <Rawdawg-1> all about the company, where it started and how they grew so big
2014-10-09T23:49:37  <cosmo> probably the same story as alibaba
2014-10-09T23:49:46  <Rawdawg-1> yea but in english
2014-10-09T23:49:48  <Rawdawg-1> haha jk
2014-10-09T23:49:57  <cosmo> lol
2014-10-09T23:50:22  <Wolf`> Rawdawg-1: So, you mine?
2014-10-09T23:50:23  <cosmo> they got in as the net was taking off, knew how good it'd be for commerce, and simply tried harder than their competitors
2014-10-09T23:50:47  <Rawdawg-1> yea kind of cosmo
2014-10-09T23:50:54  <Rawdawg-1> Wolf`: i do a bit of everything
2014-10-09T23:51:21  <Rawdawg-1> im what others have dubbed a "Whale"
2014-10-09T23:51:40  <Wolf`> Rawdawg-1: Ah, I see.
2014-10-09T23:52:01  <cosmo> barnacles need someone to take em places
2014-10-09T23:52:06  <Rawdawg-1> i now have almost 2k LTC, 1.1 mil DGC, 1.6 mil RBY
2014-10-09T23:52:23  <Wolf`> Well, if you've got a farm; you know where to find me for more hash :3
2014-10-09T23:52:24  <Rawdawg-1> and i also manage a trading fund for others to make profit off of my ideas
2014-10-09T23:52:46  <cosmo> whatcha think of ruby stalling?
2014-10-09T23:52:48  <Rawdawg-1> cryptsy has a new thing opening up soon i think
2014-10-09T23:52:56  <Rawdawg-1> im not overly happy about it cosmo
2014-10-09T23:53:02  <cosmo> yeah
2014-10-09T23:53:11  <Rawdawg-1> but theres nothing i can do about it cept ride them till its fixed
2014-10-09T23:53:13  <cosmo> kinda why i think you're crazy :D not saying i'm not
2014-10-09T23:53:33  <Rawdawg-1> i know they have a good team, RBY is going to be long term though
2014-10-09T23:53:34  <cosmo> i find it hard to believe after 10 days kass hasn't found a fix
2014-10-09T23:54:19  <cosmo> it's landlocked, it's not gonna get a pump, whales are too distributed
2014-10-09T23:54:48  <Wolf`> I don't get trading, tbh - I mean, I kind of do
2014-10-09T23:54:57  <cosmo> it's not trading, it's whale watching
2014-10-09T23:55:09  <cosmo> i think someones been consolidating whitecoin
2014-10-09T23:55:17  <Wolf`> either predict people's movements or force it by frightening them
2014-10-09T23:55:25  <Wolf`> but... too risky for me
2014-10-09T23:55:29  <cosmo> ie BitcoinEXpress and monero
2014-10-09T23:55:34  <Rawdawg-1> im an ex (soon to be back into it) Bay St stock broker/trader
2014-10-09T23:55:40  <cosmo> XMR might be a good buy too what with all the fud
2014-10-09T23:55:41  <Wolf`> Easier to make profit by mining faster than everyone else
2014-10-09T23:55:47  <Rawdawg-1> so im a trader by nature
2014-10-09T23:56:40  <cosmo> i need an ass kicking to get my focus straight
2014-10-09T23:57:10  <RunningmanZ> Rawdawg-1:nice little stash u have going there
2014-10-09T23:57:15  <RunningmanZ> :D
2014-10-09T23:57:19  <cosmo> else i'll just sit here pissing my shit away like a dorkus
2014-10-09T23:57:43  <Wolf`> I like surer ways of making money
2014-10-09T23:58:07  <cosmo> yeah, i'll get a job sooner or later
2014-10-09T23:58:11  <Wolf`> Fix a little code to ensure you have a quite substantial advantage, then buy up GPUs and mine away
2014-10-09T23:58:18  <Rawdawg-1> you put 1$ in my hand i can make it into 5 np at all
2014-10-09T23:58:25  <Wolf`> All you've gotta to do maintain it and tweak it if you want
2014-10-09T23:58:26  <Rawdawg-1> sure enough for me :P
2014-10-09T23:58:33  <Wolf`> besides that - collect it and smile
2014-10-10T00:00:39  <Wolf`> Rawdawg-1: but can you make a steady income of it - passive income?
2014-10-10T00:01:07  <cosmo> he's past that point man
2014-10-10T00:01:26  <Wolf`> Shit, I don't even have a farm to take advantage of my own shit - not yet. Leasing it allows the same passive income, although less of it - while starting from nothing.
2014-10-10T00:01:26  <Rawdawg-1> yea im way past that
2014-10-10T00:01:49  <Rawdawg-1> im a millionare in the "real world"
2014-10-10T00:01:52  <cosmo> comfortably crowdsurfing on hordes of plebs
2014-10-10T00:01:57  <Wolf`> Damn, congrats, then
2014-10-10T00:02:01  <Rawdawg-1> ty ty lol
2014-10-10T00:02:08  <Rawdawg-1> also i lold at that cosmo
2014-10-10T00:02:13  <cosmo> carrying him around hoping some change'll fall out of his pockets
2014-10-10T00:02:25  <Wolf`> I was broke - got out of high school a year ago
2014-10-10T00:02:26  <cosmo> people bring it on themselves lol
2014-10-10T00:02:46  <Rawdawg-1> i retired at 23 man
2014-10-10T00:02:59  <Rawdawg-1> so get to work and make it happen :P
2014-10-10T00:03:03  <Wolf`> But not anymore, and I'm moving up - started making money out of nothing
2014-10-10T00:03:03  <Rawdawg-1> if i can do it, you can too
2014-10-10T00:03:07  <cosmo> i'm turning 23 in december :s
2014-10-10T00:03:09  <Rawdawg-1> good job man
2014-10-10T00:03:11  <Wolf`> You damn right.
2014-10-10T00:03:18  <Rawdawg-1> nice cosmo, get to it bro
2014-10-10T00:03:31  <cosmo> idk i think it'd be fun to pass out drunk in a hammock on the side of a freeway
2014-10-10T00:03:35  <cosmo> that's my idea of a good time
2014-10-10T00:03:41  <Rawdawg-1> LOL
2014-10-10T00:03:49  <Rawdawg-1> gotta do something on tuesdays i guess
2014-10-10T00:03:59  <cosmo> my only real goal is owning a house, and having a job somewhere quiet like a library
2014-10-10T00:03:59  <Wolf`> Miners are great - I can take some shit code from the public GPU miner, and make it far faster - then get someone with a huge farm paying me a percentage :D
2014-10-10T00:04:07  <Wolf`> That's where I'm starting
2014-10-10T00:04:11  <Wolf`> once I have money
2014-10-10T00:04:17  <Wolf`> then I need to use that to make more
2014-10-10T00:04:20  <Rawdawg-1> thats a good way to start Wolf`
2014-10-10T00:04:30  <cosmo> what other way is there
2014-10-10T00:04:34  <cosmo> strongarm robbery?
2014-10-10T00:04:34  <Rawdawg-1> and yea thats a good idea cosmo, gotta have a dream to work toward
2014-10-10T00:04:49  <Wolf`> cosmo: I didn't rob anyone to start, and I didn't have a dime lol
2014-10-10T00:05:05  <cosmo> heh i know
2014-10-10T00:05:13  <cosmo> get another big deal down man
2014-10-10T00:05:29  <Rawdawg-1> i started with 500$, a shitty apartment in a terrible neighbourhood and a buspass
2014-10-10T00:05:59  <Rawdawg-1> just enough to make it 1 month
2014-10-10T00:06:03  <Rawdawg-1> thats all
2014-10-10T00:06:15  <cosmo> aren't you a certified electrician?
2014-10-10T00:06:23  <Rawdawg-1> yep
2014-10-10T00:06:33  <cosmo> yeah
2014-10-10T00:06:34  <Rawdawg-1> but before that i had nothing
2014-10-10T00:06:38  <Wolf`> I've got living expenses good for now - still, one fuckup happens and I could lose that; I need to get multiple income streams - several farmers across wildly different algorithms, so if the public advances on one, the improvements will be useless on the others.
2014-10-10T00:06:46  <Rawdawg-1> im talking about before i had my elec certs
2014-10-10T00:06:47  <vinje> hey man, I was ust wondering if you were still kickin :)

2014-10-10T00:07:43  * Wolf` hasn't ever had a real job
2014-10-10T00:07:58  <cosmo> 'real' job
2014-10-10T00:07:59  <Rawdawg-1> no i started by cleaning out my cousins bosses van one day
2014-10-10T00:08:16  <Rawdawg-1> and he hired me cash under the table (less than min wage)
2014-10-10T00:08:27  <Rawdawg-1> to do shit that other people were getting double the money for
2014-10-10T00:08:30  <Wolf`> cosmo: As in, an official job - getting paid in BTC for miner shit isn't really a job lol
2014-10-10T00:08:36  <Rawdawg-1> worked my way up
2014-10-10T00:09:17  <Rawdawg-1> im going back to toronto this week

2014-10-10T00:10:39  <cosmo> if you're trying to setup business it makes sense
2014-10-10T00:10:44  <Rawdawg-1> yea and i am
2014-10-10T00:10:54  <Wolf`> Shit, when I've got plenty, I plan on vacationing elsewhere. Maybe I'll have a place in the Philippines or Thailand :3
2014-10-10T00:10:57  <Rawdawg-1> going to do some Cryto Consulting
2014-10-10T00:11:08  <Rawdawg-1> I have a place in Costa Rica now too
2014-10-10T00:11:14  <samson_> I'm in Thailand Wolf
2014-10-10T00:11:47  <Rawdawg-1> bought it a day before i bought the toronto condo
2014-10-10T00:11:47  <samson_> I've been here for years now
2014-10-10T00:12:01  <Rawdawg-1> got a condo on the beach down there for 30k
2014-10-10T00:12:05  <Rawdawg-1> jaco beach
2014-10-10T00:12:44  <Wolf`> samson_: For real?
2014-10-10T00:12:45  <Wolf`> Nice
2014-10-10T00:12:51  <Wolf`> I want to go - just...
2014-10-10T00:12:54  <samson_> Yes, I liv ein Hua Hin
2014-10-10T00:12:59  <Wolf`> ugh, fucking ban on amphetamines.
2014-10-10T00:13:23  <samson_> You can get certain prescriptions from international hospitals
2014-10-10T00:13:33  <Wolf`> samson_: I have my own prescription
2014-10-10T00:13:44  <samson_> Yeah - that wouldn't work out too well here
2014-10-10T00:13:45  <Wolf`> I just dunno if I'd be able to take it in the country
2014-10-10T00:13:50  <Wolf`> I figured.
2014-10-10T00:13:57  <samson_> Yo ucan bring it with you
2014-10-10T00:14:24  <Wolf`> So since I have a script in the US, it's legal there? No catch?
2014-10-10T00:14:25  <samson_> But only a certain amount of days supply, then you need a local doctor to prescribe more - but top rate Doctors are cheap as hell here
2014-10-10T00:14:33  <Wolf`> ah, I see
2014-10-10T00:14:36  <Wolf`> that's awesome :D
2014-10-10T00:14:52  <samson_> You can't use the script but you can bring an initial supply then go to the hospital
2014-10-10T00:15:09  <Wolf`> makes sense
2014-10-10T00:15:11  <samson_> Don't get too carried away though - some common drugs in the west are outright banned here
2014-10-10T00:15:47  <samson_> You can see a specialist consultant in any field for like $30-50, regular doctor cheaper
2014-10-10T00:15:48  <Wolf`> oooh, wait - you guys don't have the fucking DEA, so the doc could prescribe me any reasonable amount. My doc wants to give me more, but the DEA have a limit :(
2014-10-10T00:16:22  <vinje> damn, just looked up hua hin.  Nice place :)
2014-10-10T00:16:25  <samson_> Would you believe it the US does have a large DEA contingent working in Thailand
2014-10-10T00:16:34  <vinje> ^yes
2014-10-10T00:16:40  <Wolf`> probably
2014-10-10T00:16:41  <vinje> because pricks be prickin
2014-10-10T00:16:42  <samson_> And Secret Service - I know someone who knows someone
2014-10-10T00:16:46  <Wolf`> playing world police is what they do
2014-10-10T00:16:49  <Wolf`> assholes
2014-10-10T00:17:14  <samson_> The 'SS' are looking for money counterfeiters of which I heard there are plenty
2014-10-10T00:17:48  <vinje> rawdawg-1 i've been playing Destiny on 360 with my 13yr old.  A bit of Eve markets.
2014-10-10T00:17:48  <samson_> For example Cambodia uses USD as their main currency - their own currency is worth shit - that's like one country along
2014-10-10T00:17:53  <Wolf`> meh, I really wanna just vacation there
2014-10-10T00:18:25  <samson_> You won't have a problem for vacation of say 3 months
2014-10-10T00:18:43  <samson_> visas for very long stays can be tricky
2014-10-10T00:19:07  <Wolf`> 3 months? I'd wanna stay for maybe 2-3 weeks
2014-10-10T00:19:19  <samson_> I bought mine on some 'elite' program they offer - 5 years straight up
2014-10-10T00:19:29  <samson_> 2-3 weeks - no visa rquired at all
2014-10-10T00:19:49  <samson_> no tax, no nothing
2014-10-10T00:19:55  <Rawdawg-1> nice vinje
2014-10-10T00:20:09  <Rawdawg-1> i did the raid then stopped playing to deal with some personal stuff
2014-10-10T00:20:43  <Rawdawg-1> and vinje, if you are interested in coming to toronto any time soon, hit me up and we can share a place
2014-10-10T00:21:02  <samson_> 50k dump on Cryptsy
2014-10-10T00:21:17  <Rawdawg-1> when samson_?
2014-10-10T00:21:25  <samson_> very recently
2014-10-10T00:21:44  <samson_> or could be combination of buy / dumop - hard to tell - it's on the daily chart
2014-10-10T00:21:45  <Rawdawg-1> i bought a bunch the other night
2014-10-10T00:21:55  <samson_> Last couple of hours by the looks of it
2014-10-10T00:23:00  <samson_> could even have been a big 'buy up' slightly over the .0000295 'bot fixed' price
2014-10-10T00:24:45  <samson_> The cryptsy charts are wrong anyway
2014-10-10T00:24:51  <samson_> Volume is incorrect
2014-10-10T00:25:08  <samson_> I bought 30k the other day and it only showed up as something like 10k
2014-10-10T00:26:08  <Rawdawg-1> yea, i bought 22k last night i think it was
2014-10-10T00:26:20  <Rawdawg-1> could have been the night before and its not showing up
2014-10-10T00:26:31  <samson_> they suck
2014-10-10T00:26:47  <samson_> or lie
2014-10-10T00:26:52  <samson_> one or the other
2014-10-10T00:31:02  <Wolf`> Everyone calls it Shitsy for a reason
2014-10-10T00:31:13  <Wolf`> And we all know Vern is a little shady
2014-10-10T00:32:30  <samson_> Well I'm using btc38 for now, I'll use cryptsy if there's an order there I want
2014-10-10T00:34:40  <RunningmanZ> i hope they dumped into my .5 btc buy at 28
2014-10-10T00:35:19  <samson_> not even touched
2014-10-10T00:35:30  <RunningmanZ> bugger
2014-10-10T00:35:31  <RunningmanZ> lol
2014-10-10T00:35:49  <samson_> sometimes you gotta buy it up
2014-10-10T00:37:59  <RunningmanZ> yeah for sure. Just waiting for the right size sell order
2014-10-10T01:12:00  <RunningmanZ> samson_:is btc38 easier to use yet? Last time I tried it was a nightmare trying to decipher the 'Chinglish'
2014-10-10T01:13:16  <RunningmanZ> u can only login via FB?
2014-10-10T01:14:59  <RunningmanZ> Actually i just logged in using the english site version. Shows how long since i have been there lol
2014-10-10T01:27:15  <samson_> yeah, they changed it amonths ago
2014-10-10T01:27:32  <samson_> I still use the QQ login but I guess facebook makes it easier
2014-10-10T01:27:50  <samson_> Why don't they have their own login system - that's the strange part.
2014-10-10T01:29:20  <samson_> after I login on the Chinese side I change the URL from www.btc38 to en.btc38 and it swaps over to English - good enough - figured it out by accident
2014-10-10T01:35:00  <RunningmanZ> I just requested if Haas can add BTC38 support for the bot
2014-10-10T01:35:08  <RunningmanZ> so i can trade on there
2014-10-10T01:36:31  <RunningmanZ> yeah FB login was dead easy
2014-10-10T01:36:45  <RunningmanZ> much easier to use now with that English site
2014-10-10T01:38:51  <samson_> yep
2014-10-10T01:52:19  <RunningmanZ> samson_:I was playing around with this last night on the rift. Its cool! VR Desktop https://developer.oculusvr.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=29&t=8182

2014-10-10T15:25:58  <CoHe> I will do that right now.

2014-10-10T15:53:26  <cosmo> how much didja make tech? :D
2014-10-10T15:54:54  <cosmo> also how do # and @ signs work in twitter.. should i be putting a # before every buzzword i say to ping people?
2014-10-10T15:56:04  <techbytes-lenovo> risked 8 to make 3.29 btc
2014-10-10T15:58:34  <techbytes-lenovo> i think # is like making it keywords searchable and @ will the twitter handlers you mention them.  that's my take.
2014-10-10T15:58:56  <techbytes-lenovo> will notify
2014-10-10T16:00:20  <cosmo> ok
2014-10-10T16:00:25  <cosmo> nice profit
2014-10-10T16:02:27  <cosmo> URO has been pretty nice, it's looking like it might get another pump to .03
2014-10-10T16:06:02  <techbytes-lenovo> waiting for breakoutcoin ICO
2014-10-10T16:06:21  <techbytes-lenovo> might risk 10 btc on this one.
2014-10-10T16:15:52  <cosmo> oh man
2014-10-10T16:17:31  <cosmo> reading it now..
2014-10-10T16:28:11  <cosmo> 14 million premine, only 7million will be released in the first 2 years, sounds ideal
2014-10-10T16:29:31  <techbytes-lenovo> hopefully they will do the ICO on bittrex
2014-10-10T16:34:22  <cosmo> alright.. i'll try this one

2014-10-11T00:48:11  <RunningmanZ> Some pics there as well
2014-10-11T01:10:29  <samson_> Maybe some innovation will come out of this conference
2014-10-11T01:10:41  <Wolf`> samson_: Innovation where?
2014-10-11T01:10:51  <Wolf`> in coins? I hope so.
2014-10-11T01:10:57  <Wolf`> In ASICs? I hope not. :P
2014-10-11T01:11:17  <samson_> I'm thinking more on the protocol level
2014-10-11T01:11:22  <Wolf`> ah
2014-10-11T01:11:26  <samson_> I'm not a fan of the asics
2014-10-11T01:11:34  <Wolf`> me neither
2014-10-11T01:11:38  <samson_> I think they have a place though
2014-10-11T01:12:07  <Wolf`> Sure, but those rabid BTC fangirls act like they are an inevitability and are always a good thing.
2014-10-11T01:12:56  <samson_> Yep - the hardcore asic guys (entire BTC dev team ?) are full of shit on them
2014-10-11T01:14:00  <Wolf`> Nah, I think gmaxwell whined about them one time
2014-10-11T01:14:05  <Wolf`> but the rest? Yep
2014-10-11T01:14:06  <samson_> They have a PDF which explains why it's a 'good' thing to stick with sha256 and not complicate things further
2014-10-11T01:14:22  <Wolf`> Inertia and not panicking the sheep.

2014-10-11T01:19:04  <samson_> They say the proof of work should be optimisation free....
2014-10-11T01:20:16  <samson_> If you ever go into #bitcoin-dev or even #bitcoin-wizards and talk about different approaches to proof of work someone will send you a link to that PDF lol
2014-10-11T01:23:43  <cosmo> seems like sunny king's pos implementation works well enough
2014-10-11T01:25:03  <samson_> Did he ever reveal how it works ?
2014-10-11T01:25:18  <samson_> I know that was a big thing way back when it first came around
2014-10-11T01:26:03  <samson_> He refused to speak about it in any detail from what I remember - I haven't been back since I dumped my PPC making hundreds of BTC
2014-10-11T01:28:54  <cosmo> i dunno
2014-10-11T01:29:05  <cosmo> regardless it's open source
2014-10-11T01:30:21  <cosmo> he's not really obligated to, and seeing as every pos coin is probably forked from ppc there's more than enough proof that the system's functional
2014-10-11T01:31:11  <samson_> This was like 18 months ago, I'm sure he's published more information on it by now
2014-10-11T01:32:36  <cosmo> meh
2014-10-11T01:32:43  <cosmo> i'm still holding 1.8k ppc
2014-10-11T01:34:10  <cosmo> i'm hoping it'll hit 5$ someday
2014-10-11T01:35:07  <cosmo> all in all, about 27btc to my name
2014-10-11T01:35:55  <Wolf`> cosmo: wow, not bad
2014-10-11T01:36:25  <samson_> I don't have that many any more, not since the Gox incident
2014-10-11T01:37:20  <samson_> If I eventually get about 23% back that will be about 33 BTC
2014-10-11T01:37:49  <cosmo> back from gox?
2014-10-11T01:38:01  <cosmo> and yeah Wolf` i'm holding onto these suckers
2014-10-11T01:38:19  <cosmo> put 1k into bitcoin when it was ~10$, pulled out 2.2k, holding the rest for a down payment on some real estate
2014-10-11T01:38:35  <Wolf`> I've been saying Gox was a scam before it was cool :P
2014-10-11T01:38:47  <Wolf`> I remember all the issues it had a year before the big scam
2014-10-11T01:39:14  <cosmo> the most lucrative point in all history to be a hacker..
2014-10-11T01:39:26  <Wolf`> Heh, no.
2014-10-11T01:39:44  <samson_> The thing is I trusted BTC-e less than I trusted Gox
2014-10-11T01:39:46  <Wolf`> I would say when banks first started using computers and the internet
2014-10-11T01:39:58  <Wolf`> samson_: I trusted BTC-E FAR more than Gox, always
2014-10-11T01:40:05  <cosmo> ditto
2014-10-11T01:40:10  <samson_> And at the time the other exchanges were a pile of shit with little volume
2014-10-11T01:40:19  <Wolf`> BTC-E is my mainstay
2014-10-11T01:40:28  <cosmo> i wish btc-e would take on more coins
2014-10-11T01:40:35  <Wolf`> same here
2014-10-11T01:40:46  <Wolf`> I don't use it often because I'm trading other coins
2014-10-11T01:41:16  <samson_> They have very shady business practices - fake companies to launder incoming wires - you must state it's for purchasing online advertising - again this was over a year ago so maybe it's changed these days
2014-10-11T01:41:44  <Wolf`> samson_: Part of the reason I like it.
2014-10-11T01:41:56  <cosmo> ^ditto again
2014-10-11T01:42:07  <Wolf`> This is a world where financial privacy has become illegal
2014-10-11T01:42:10  <samson_> This is the reason one day there will be a raid and everything will disappear
2014-10-11T01:42:22  <Wolf`> samson_: Not a certainty
2014-10-11T01:42:59  <Wolf`> and besides, I'd rather support people who believe in what's right than run away from them so that I'm not hurt by the thugs that want to stop them
2014-10-11T01:43:01  <samson_> No, and I would have lost nothing if I stuck with BTC-e - instead I lost 145 BTC
2014-10-11T01:43:19  <Wolf`> Ouch.
2014-10-11T01:43:25  <Wolf`> That's a major loss.
2014-10-11T01:43:45  <samson_> I know
2014-10-11T01:43:54  <Wolf`> Sorry.
2014-10-11T01:44:10  <samson_> My coins normally stayed on my hard drive and I taded them rarely but BTC hit the top which is when it's time to trade
2014-10-11T01:44:16  <samson_> So I made my choice
2014-10-11T01:44:49  <samson_> I was waiting for lower prices when it went to shit
2014-10-11T01:45:28  <cosmo> what's the status on karpeles, is he in jail yet
2014-10-11T01:45:42  <Wolf`> cosmo: I hope he's in the ground.
2014-10-11T01:45:49  <samson_> LOL, of course not
2014-10-11T01:46:08  <Wolf`> Which is actually rather likely, seeing as he just ripped off a stupid amount from a lot of people.
2014-10-11T01:46:21  <samson_> not yet anyway but the police are investigating the whole incident
2014-10-11T01:46:46  <samson_> It's going to be well into 2015 before anything happens from what I've heard
2014-10-11T01:47:22  <cosmo> great
2014-10-11T01:48:06  <samson_> There is a chance that a lot of the 'missing' coins didn't exist and were inflated values - nobody really knows what happened until some kind of audit is performed
2014-10-11T01:48:32  <Wolf`> If he does end up getting charged, he'll spent ten years going from a jail cell to a courtroom before he even starts to serve his sentence lol
2014-10-11T01:48:52  <samson_> I suspect a lot of people won't come forward and claim their coins for one reason or another - illegal reasons for example - this will only increase the percentage payout for the rest of us who were already verified there
2014-10-11T01:49:27  <cosmo> where'd the 23% you mentioned earlier come from?
2014-10-11T01:49:55  <samson_> I suspect he will do a runner before any charges are even filed, all I can hope is that he comes to Thailand and I bump into him on my travels
2014-10-11T01:50:12  <samson_> I'll get my coins back then
2014-10-11T01:50:14  <samson_> lol
2014-10-11T01:50:37  <cosmo> yeah right
2014-10-11T01:50:44  <cosmo> they probably were hacked tbh
2014-10-11T01:50:57  <cosmo> if they had coins, they're dispersed amoungst the underworld now
2014-10-11T01:51:10  <samson_> They do have just over 200k BTC left though
2014-10-11T01:51:29  <samson_> They were 'found' after the 'incident'
2014-10-11T01:51:50  <cosmo> so karpeles had a paper wallet and didn't mention it till he had to
2014-10-11T01:52:13  <samson_> These 202k I think it was are now in the posession of the court appointed administrator
2014-10-11T01:52:29  <samson_> Yes, this is one which was misplaced at some point
2014-10-11T01:53:08  <samson_> Some people were hunting the coins down and found them - then there was a sudden announcement about finding 200k coins
2014-10-11T01:53:36  <samson_> Witout external guys tracking them down I think they would never have been 'found' at all
2014-10-11T01:54:00  <cosmo> probably
2014-10-11T01:54:24  <cosmo> karp was probably saving them to pay off the people who had the means to find him and kill him
2014-10-11T01:54:47  <cosmo> was mt. gox seriously a magic trading card exchange originally?
2014-10-11T01:54:52  <samson_> no
2014-10-11T01:55:30  <samson_> But that was the original plan by Jeb Mcaleb (spelling?) - the domain was registered and they just went with it
2014-10-11T01:56:28  <samson_> But those cards were never traded on the domain from what I read, they ditched the idea and decided to steal Bitcoins instead
2014-10-11T01:59:28  <Wolf`> lol
2014-10-11T01:59:30  <cosmo> i doubt they stole anything
2014-10-11T01:59:36  <Wolf`> dunno if that was their starting intention
2014-10-11T01:59:42  <cosmo> it was an indie exchange that caught all the btc hype
2014-10-11T02:00:19  <cosmo> they should've been way more prudent, making millions of dollars worth of transactions though
2014-10-11T02:00:52  <cosmo> pretty fucking stupid of them to not expect attention from hackers
2014-10-11T02:02:09  <Wolf`> They likely got hacked
2014-10-11T02:02:14  <Wolf`> then ran off with the rest
2014-10-11T02:02:23  <cosmo> tried to anyway
2014-10-11T02:02:27  <Wolf`> yeah
2014-10-11T02:02:53  <cosmo> i feel bad for em but yeah, they dug their own grave
2014-10-11T02:03:13  <samson_> I hope they get 10 years each in Japan
2014-10-11T02:03:49  <samson_> However I do feel there may be more to this story than meets the eye.
2014-10-11T02:04:16  <cosmo> weren't people tracking the stolen coins?
2014-10-11T02:04:32  <cosmo> that'd pretty much tell you everything.
2014-10-11T02:04:40  <samson_> yes, they still are - apparently some of them were on the move recently
2014-10-11T02:04:52  <samson_> ##mtgox-talk
2014-10-11T02:04:56  <Wolf`> lol
2014-10-11T02:05:29  <cosmo> well, if i had coins lost i'd be following it
2014-10-11T02:05:51  <cosmo> but i wonder if they're pretty much poisoned now, got enough people watching where those coins go that anyone who holds them becomes an international target
2014-10-11T02:06:03  <samson_> I check in on it every now and again. At some point there will be a claims procedure - this has been delayed until next year
2014-10-11T02:06:16  <cosmo> LOL
2014-10-11T02:06:27  <cosmo> man, depending how dispersed they've gotten so far, have fun with that.
2014-10-11T02:07:54  <samson_> Apparently the liquidator / administrator took control of them all - they are supposedly being held and Mark Karpeles has no access or control over them at all - this Koybayashi guy is in charge now (the court appointed administrator)
2014-10-11T02:09:19  <cosmo> i meant the stolen coins
2014-10-11T02:10:11  <Wolf`> Nah, no one would get coins back regardless
2014-10-11T02:10:12  <Wolf`> they'
2014-10-11T02:10:17  <Wolf`> d get USD equivalent
2014-10-11T02:10:26  <Wolf`> which is why Gox crashed their own market
2014-10-11T02:10:32  <samson_> I doubt that
2014-10-11T02:10:38  <Wolf`> they knew that and wanted to limit their losses
2014-10-11T02:10:58  <samson_> They've gone through this on mtgox-talk already
2014-10-11T02:11:25  <samson_> I believe if you had coins you can potentially claim coins, if you had USD yo ucan claim USD
2014-10-11T02:11:38  <Wolf`> ah
2014-10-11T02:11:41  <samson_> Nothing confirmed though
2014-10-11T02:12:03  <samson_> All the creditors want the coins
2014-10-11T02:12:14  <samson_> not much USD left
2014-10-11T02:12:22  <samson_> They're spending it on stupid things
2014-10-11T02:18:27  <RunningmanZ> bbl. Off to see Dad for his bday
2014-10-11T02:19:48  *** RunningmanZ is now known as RZ{bbl}
2014-10-11T02:25:17  <samson_> Does anyone get reply notifications on the new forum - I'm not getting any - none that I noticed anyway
2014-10-11T02:43:53  <cosmo> i haven't been using the new forum much
2014-10-11T03:10:29  <Wolf`> Over 600MB for a Windows driver for a wifi adapter.
2014-10-11T03:10:33  <Wolf`> What the fuck, Intel?
2014-10-11T03:11:06  <Wolf`> I mean, I know they include that shitty utility no one uses because connecting to networks using Windows is just fine
2014-10-11T03:11:09  <Wolf`> but jesus
2014-10-11T03:11:19  <Wolf`> Are you really THAT incompetent?

2014-10-11T09:49:15  <CoHe> Morning
2014-10-11T09:54:49  <Wolf`> hey
2014-10-11T09:55:01  <CoHe> Morning Wolf
2014-10-11T10:00:21  <CoHe> What you upto?
2014-10-11T10:02:04  <Wolf`> I finally downloaded AMD's dev toolkit - lots of pretty cool shit in there, but I have to use my main system, so I put an AMD card in it. Told me Skein's code was too big, so I'm rolling it up in a loop, which requires major modifications.
2014-10-11T10:03:30  <CoHe> Sound techy
2014-10-11T10:04:02  <Wolf`> Pretty much, yeah.
2014-10-11T10:04:17  <Wolf`> Except... it's slower now.
2014-10-11T10:04:19  <Wolf`> Helpful.
2014-10-11T10:05:06  <CoHe> You just mining mostly normally or trading as well?
2014-10-11T10:05:21  <Wolf`> I trade a little bit, but I don't really mine a ton
2014-10-11T10:05:29  <Wolf`> Don't have a lot of hash
2014-10-11T10:06:09  <Wolf`> btw, if you've got DRK held long term...
2014-10-11T10:06:13  <Wolf`> I'd dump it.
2014-10-11T10:06:58  <Wolf`> Heard Genesis Mining was getting into X11 from a friend of mine; they'll almost certainly mine the most profitable coin and dump it, and excepting shitcoin launches, it's usually DRK
2014-10-11T10:09:59  <CoHe> Nah I am a DGC-man solely
2014-10-11T10:11:59  <Wolf`> all right

2014-10-11T14:55:55  <cosmo> fyi, issues with DigiByte https://github.com/digibyte/DigiByteProject/issues
2014-10-11T14:55:55  <Coine1ius> (cosmo's URL) Title: Issues · digibyte/DigiByteProject · GitHub Content Type: text/html Size: Unknown
2014-10-11T15:08:47  <ahmed_vegas> Wolf`: they are
2014-10-11T15:09:00  <ahmed_vegas> they announced project X today
2014-10-11T15:10:13  <ahmed_vegas> *yesterday
2014-10-11T15:11:07  <Wolf`> ahmed_vegas: I know
2014-10-11T15:11:19  <Wolf`> Got some guys there having a little chat with them.
2014-10-11T15:12:40  <ahmed_vegas> ahh nice
2014-10-11T15:13:16  <ahmed_vegas> i dont think this is going to make a difference though in dumping though cause they must have had their GPU farm for ages
2014-10-11T15:13:16  <Wolf`> yep
2014-10-11T15:13:29  <Wolf`> ahmed_vegas: Ah, okay. Doesn't worry me :D
2014-10-11T15:13:36  <ahmed_vegas> me neither :D
2014-10-11T15:13:37  <Wolf`> If that chat goes well...
2014-10-11T15:13:45  <Wolf`> I'm money like a national bank :D
2014-10-11T15:14:01  <ahmed_vegas> Wolf`: good luck :)
2014-10-11T15:14:17  <ahmed_vegas> im guessing the chat is about selling your X11 kernel?
2014-10-11T15:14:38  <Wolf`> as well as further improvements
2014-10-11T15:15:20  <ahmed_vegas> nice, they'd be stupid not to buy it (dependent on price)
2014-10-11T15:16:00  <Wolf`> Well, 30%+ higher hashrate means it's like having another GPU in a 4 card rig
2014-10-11T15:16:16  <Wolf`> they sell hash based on hashes per second, not by rigs
2014-10-11T15:16:19  <Wolf`> so suddenly
2014-10-11T15:16:30  <Wolf`> they have 30% more to sell for free :D
2014-10-11T15:16:35  <ahmed_vegas> exactly
2014-10-11T15:17:33  <Wolf`> plus
2014-10-11T15:17:37  <Wolf`> I can make it better
2014-10-11T15:17:53  <Wolf`> which means later on, they may get 50% more hash to sell for free or something
2014-10-11T15:19:00  <ahmed_vegas> yep
2014-10-11T15:20:19  <Wolf`> well, not *free* exactly, it uses 12.84% more power
2014-10-11T15:20:27  <Wolf`> but with a 34.34% increase
2014-10-11T15:20:41  <Wolf`> it's STILL like having an extra GPU per 4 card rig
2014-10-11T15:21:29  <ahmed_vegas> yep
2014-10-11T17:43:22  <RunningmanZ> night guys

2014-10-12T23:35:43  <techbytes> what was that guy thinking dumping 30k btc at 300... but then that's probably free money for him being early adopter.
2014-10-12T23:40:48  <RunningmanZ> lol what about BCX reckons he formatted a partition that had 1700 btc on it in 2010
2014-10-12T23:45:12  <vinje> knob needs recuva
2014-10-12T23:45:17  <vinje> or something similar
2014-10-12T23:46:30  <samson_> If he did a full 'byte by byte overwriting' format then there would be no way back from that mistake
2014-10-12T23:47:08  <RunningmanZ> Yeah most likely you could get it back today if it was a quick format
2014-10-12T23:47:15  <RunningmanZ> or delete of partition etc
2014-10-12T23:47:46  <samson_> Yes, any full format or even normal disk usage and you lose the lot
2014-10-12T23:47:51  <samson_> potentially
2014-10-12T23:48:04  <RunningmanZ> I am still racking my brain trying to rememebr if i had an old hard drive with a btc wallet on it when I was playing around with mining back then

2014-10-12T23:49:02  <RunningmanZ> not getting my hopes up tho as I'm pretty sure i mined for a few hrs or so then said it was stupid heheeh

2014-10-14T13:36:50  <CoHe> kenel*
2014-10-14T13:36:55  <kenel-work> hey
2014-10-14T13:38:16  <CoHe> I havent heared a things about him lately
2014-10-14T13:43:04  <kenel-work> i'm going to upload what i was able to record (very shitily) of ahmed's speech
2014-10-14T13:43:15  <kenel-work> will take most of the day as it's about 4gb or so
2014-10-14T13:44:13  <CoHe> Interested to hear it
2014-10-14T13:44:44  <kenel-work> i was half drunk after a liquid lunch with someone and holding my cell phone in my hands for 20 minutes+ was not easy
2014-10-14T13:44:50  <kenel-work> i believe at some point i just dropped it completely
2014-10-14T13:45:20  <samson_> Baritus was in touch
2014-10-14T13:45:23  <samson_> with me
2014-10-14T13:45:37  <samson_> He said he needs someone to open up his forum account by changing the email address on it
2014-10-14T13:45:57  <kenel-work> i did that samson_
2014-10-14T13:45:59  <kenel-work> before i left for vegas
2014-10-14T13:46:05  <kenel-work> you remember?
2014-10-14T13:46:12  <kenel-work> bbl
2014-10-14T13:46:26  <samson_> Ah ok, wasn't sure if it was done or not - thought xawksow needed to do it
2014-10-14T13:46:38  <samson_> He wanted to use admin@cryptoave.com
2014-10-14T13:46:45  <samson_> I'll message him and tell him it's ready
2014-10-14T13:48:02  <samson_> I don't think I get any emails from the forum at all
2014-10-14T13:48:06  <samson_> Do they work ?
2014-10-14T13:48:38  <samson_> It might just be a setting in my profile though
