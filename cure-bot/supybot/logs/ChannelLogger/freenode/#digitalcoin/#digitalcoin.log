2014-09-16T18:13:35  <Rickus_> reward changes will do what besides price stability?
2014-09-16T18:19:43  *** marti_ is now known as [marti]
2014-09-16T18:19:44  <Eli0t> that was the point of the changes
2014-09-16T18:19:55  <xawksow> probably not that much, but price stability is important for a workin economy based on that coin.
2014-09-16T18:20:10  <xawksow> multipools are stayin hopefully away
2014-09-16T18:20:18  <xawksow> we got not that much dump pressure @ exchanges

2014-09-16T18:27:02  <Rickus_> right, but the flipside is that by reducing it, the miners will be rewarded 66% less. Although the X11 algo will be 3 times more efficient. .. sooo?

2014-09-16T18:30:38  <xawksow> well i assume nearly 90% are mining with asics

2014-09-16T18:47:55  <cosmo> we should get that done soon, posts from our current digitalcoin.co/forums can be moved over no problem?

2014-09-16T18:48:28  <xawksow> cosmo, yea. we can do it as soon as we get the domain
2014-09-16T18:48:52  <cosmo> can we do that? the sooner the better, a lot of people are gonna get interested in DGC
2014-09-16T18:48:59  <cosmo> don't wanna jerk them around between forums.

2014-09-16T18:51:30  <xawksow> ok
2014-09-16T18:56:06  <Rickus_> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJOBw9fCkeE OK
2014-09-16T18:57:48  <Rickus_> wait, I'm confused by your post here: Every algorithm gives 5 DGC per 40 seconds, this results in a total of 15 DGC per 120 seconds. Before it gave 15 DGC every 40 seconds.
2014-09-16T18:59:34  <Rickus_> how does that work when x11 is up to 5x faster?
2014-09-16T19:00:05  <Eli0t> the diff is harder?
2014-09-16T19:00:19  <Rickus_> on that algo specifically?
2014-09-16T19:00:56  <xawksow> every algo has its own diff
2014-09-16T19:01:04  <xawksow> independent of each other
2014-09-16T19:01:09  <xawksow> to match the block times
2014-09-16T19:01:22  <xawksow> diff retarget is every block
2014-09-16T19:01:23  <Eli0t> so diff is really low atm on sha and x11?
2014-09-16T19:01:29  <xawksow> exactly
2014-09-16T19:01:39  <Eli0t> where are the pools
2014-09-16T19:01:57  <xawksow> we solomined in the test
2014-09-16T19:02:03  <xawksow> directly into the testwallet
2014-09-16T19:02:57  <xawksow> so no pools :p
2014-09-16T19:10:18  <Rickus_> so there's no benefit of switching to x11 besides the lower power usage for gpus then.
2014-09-16T19:14:32  <xawksow> and that there are no asics which increase the diff that hard

2014-09-16T19:20:31  <Rickus_> I don't quite understand.
2014-09-16T19:20:45  *** ChanServ sets mode: +o techbytes
2014-09-16T19:21:56  <Rickus_> in laymans terms, how will another algo like x11 be free of the diff increase on scrypt if they all are going to match the same blocktime?
2014-09-16T19:23:00  <techbytes> magic
2014-09-16T19:23:32  <Rickus_> :D
2014-09-16T19:24:11  <Rickus_> k, perhaps a lil more detail
2014-09-16T19:24:23  <Rickus_> I may be blond, but...
2014-09-16T19:24:34  <cosmo> the first algo to find the solution encrypts the block
2014-09-16T19:24:57  <cosmo> same rules as normal block propogation, as soon as the network understands a new block is added to the chain, all the algos start over.
2014-09-16T19:25:37  <cosmo> Myriadcoin has five algos, targeted at 2.5minutes per solution, which means on average a block is found every 30 seconds
2014-09-16T19:27:02  <Rickus_> ah, so since the hash rate is higher on x11 for gpus, the chance of finding that solution on x11 will be 4-5 time more than scrypt regardless of network algo hash rate.
2014-09-16T19:27:23  <cosmo> no, because they're all targeted for the same time
2014-09-16T19:27:31  <cosmo> it should be even odds across all algos
2014-09-16T19:28:48  <cosmo> the odds would matter based on how my people are on each algo, not hashpower... how many hands are the rewards falling into
2014-09-16T19:29:25  <cosmo> you have three network pools fighting for the right to encrypt the next block on one chain.
2014-09-16T19:29:36  <Rickus_> hmm, so the payout for gpu miners will be the same regardless of algo?
2014-09-16T19:29:44  <Rickus_> right
2014-09-16T19:29:52  <cosmo> currently yeah
2014-09-16T19:30:19  <cosmo> i wanted to merge-mine SHA and scrypt and give them miniscule rewards, with the x11 algo getting most of the coins minted.
2014-09-16T19:31:16  <cosmo> so 2/3rd of the chain is basically secured for free, while loyal miners could get rewards with their GPU's
2014-09-16T19:32:07  <cosmo> but merge-mining somewhat locks the network down since every asic in the world is on it then, makes it a lot harder to get everyone to update in case people want to fork to something new.
2014-09-16T19:32:07  <Rickus_> so the only benefit for gpu miners to switch to x11 will be that the power usage is a bit lower and that the chance to find the solution will go up (vs scrypt)?
2014-09-16T19:33:12  <cosmo> chance to find the solution should be the same regardless of what algo, it's still PoW, your chances are based off how much hash you have compared to the rest of the network
2014-09-16T19:33:37  <cosmo> there are just three networks here, so if you have GPU's it'd be better to mine x11 since Scrypt would probably be full of scrypt ASICs. no ASICs for X11 afaik.

2014-09-18T19:09:24  <techbytes> maybe he needs to be reminded that dgc wasn't premine and foundation is working hard on only donations.

2014-09-18T19:10:23  <BittrexBill> ??

2014-09-18T19:11:27  <BittrexBill> ??
2014-09-18T19:12:52  <Trenal> So you charge coins to be added?
2014-09-18T19:13:02  <Trenal> Pretty lame, its your exchange
2014-09-18T19:13:12  <samson_> That's great for pre mined scams but DGC isn't a pre mined scam
2014-09-18T19:13:46  <ahmed_> BittrexBill:  ive skipped the middleman thanks. ritchie has added DGC back to the top of his consider list
2014-09-18T19:13:52  <duuuuude> dont take it so seriously, they only want one thing money
2014-09-18T19:14:14  <cosmo> damn bitcoin
2014-09-18T19:14:26  <samson_> !btc
2014-09-18T19:14:27  <ahmed_> im sorry but if you guys do research into coins as your supposed to, you'd realise us devs are working free of charge from our goodwill

2014-09-18T19:14:44  <cosmo> 412 on btc-e
2014-09-18T19:14:55  <duuuuude> you guys are doing good work, dont let the idiots get you down
2014-09-18T19:15:05  <techbytes> what's the bottom now?
2014-09-18T19:15:17  <cosmo> touched 400
2014-09-18T19:15:28  <samson_> Oh man, I'd love to see a crash into the $200's
2014-09-18T19:15:29  <techbytes> sheesh, i was buying all the way down to 450..
2014-09-18T19:15:34  <cosmo> and PPC is going up! :D
2014-09-18T19:15:47  <Eli0t> and xpm
2014-09-18T19:15:47  <duuuuude> btc will go back up, its what it does
2014-09-18T19:15:51  <BittrexBill> I understand your premine scams and that you are not one. Most exchanges charge a lot more , maybe we could accept 0.3btc to add directs to markets?
2014-09-18T19:15:56  <cosmo> duuuuude, totally will
2014-09-18T19:16:15  <Trenal> I can't believe you would charge a developer to add a coin
2014-09-18T19:16:17  <Trenal> so you make money
2014-09-18T19:16:22  <cosmo> MMmPh such a good day, there is a semblance of ration in these markets after all
2014-09-18T19:16:24  <techbytes> BittrexBill, we never paid any of the exchanges to be added and we are not doing it now.
2014-09-18T19:16:32  <Trenal> Here developer, pay for my hosting costs for 2 years
2014-09-18T19:16:48  <cosmo> i don't see what the issue is
2014-09-18T19:16:51  <duuuuude> thats what they are, its not like they care about cryptos or something, there are there to make money, so just remember that when you think trex
2014-09-18T19:17:26  <cosmo> .3btc sounds reasonable, though i'd like to know how much you guys make in trading fee's being the #1 altcoin trading exchange :p
2014-09-18T19:17:40  <BittrexBill> We are making good volume for your coin if we were to add it
2014-09-18T19:17:43  <duuuuude> yes and anyone could pay to get on exchange, bribing is easy, getting on a exchange because of skill and hardwork is actually something
2014-09-18T19:18:20  <cosmo> what made you come in here BittrexBill? someone refer you to DGC?
2014-09-18T19:18:38  <ahmed_> bittrex-ryan: any comment here bro?
2014-09-18T19:18:41  <techbytes> BittrexBill, does .3 btc really going to make a difference to your bottom line as oppose to the love you will receive from this community if you just added DGC?
2014-09-18T19:18:46  <BittrexBill> yes we make trading fees as why we are charging small fees to be added not like others.
2014-09-18T19:19:01  <ahmed_> BittrexBill: others dont take bribes thats the big difference
2014-09-18T19:19:19  <cosmo> ahmed_ mintpal took tons of bribes
2014-09-18T19:19:26  <cosmo> idk about cryptsy
2014-09-18T19:19:32  <duuuuude> its very easy your either for people and cryptos, or your just about profit.
2014-09-18T19:19:34  <ahmed_> cosmo: mintpal's under new management tho
2014-09-18T19:19:36  <duuuuude> we now know
2014-09-18T19:19:42  <ahmed_> cryptsy hasnt from what im aware
2014-09-18T19:19:48  <cosmo> meh
2014-09-18T19:19:52  <ahmed_> ive tried a lot to convince them to add coins in the backroom
2014-09-18T19:20:03  <ahmed_> but they wont. only if it meets their set criteria
2014-09-18T19:20:13  <duuuuude> you kind of have to be in the inner circle of cryptsy to get coins on
2014-09-18T19:20:18  <BittrexBill> Yes mint pal takes 10-20btc just for paid voting!!! We ask 0.3 for direct adding
2014-09-18T19:20:19  <ahmed_> duuuuude: i was
2014-09-18T19:20:20  <cosmo> there's so little competition, honestly .3btc sounds fine, being on bittrex would be cool.
2014-09-18T19:20:38  <duuuuude> but it just lets them charge more devs, there has to be a stand
2014-09-18T19:20:41  <ahmed_> even then they dont just add any shitcoin
2014-09-18T19:21:04  <cosmo> business involves getting your hands dirty.
2014-09-18T19:21:05  <duuuuude> i do respect that a little
2014-09-18T19:21:08  <ahmed_> BittrexBill: even still one of your own staff members is a big DGC supporter
2014-09-18T19:21:14  <duuuuude> only dirty people say that
2014-09-18T19:21:26  <ahmed_> that says a lot about this coin
2014-09-18T19:21:51  <cosmo> is this fight seriously over whether or not we should pay a fee
2014-09-18T19:21:56  <ahmed_> cosmo: yes
2014-09-18T19:21:59  <techbytes> BittrexBill, how about i send you the .3 btc from my account on BITTREX and you add dgc?
2014-09-18T19:22:00  <duuuuude> no its the principle
2014-09-18T19:22:07  <cosmo> lol
2014-09-18T19:22:21  <ahmed_> we shouldnt be paying to be added. we've never paid before and we should never have to
2014-09-18T19:22:25  <BittrexBill> Yes I know and such as why we wish to add it. I honestly think 0.3 btc is a fair option for direct adding, do you not
2014-09-18T19:22:42  <cosmo> ya'll just excited cuz the guy who calls the shots for bittrex is in here, i wouldn't blow it.
2014-09-18T19:22:56  <duuuuude> you would ad anything for .3 =(
2014-09-18T19:22:59  <samson_> BittrexBill: <aybe it would be fare if there were zero fee trading for a couple of months or something
2014-09-18T19:23:00  <ahmed_> cosmo: nope. ritchie calls the shots too
2014-09-18T19:23:03  <samson_> *Maybe
2014-09-18T19:23:13  <ahmed_> and hes been in the legitpools chan for months
2014-09-18T19:23:22  <cosmo> yeah samson_, give us lower trading fees BittrexBill :D
2014-09-18T19:23:27  <BittrexBill> Ok I can work at this please give me a moment
2014-09-18T19:23:36  <duuuuude> oh, that is something
2014-09-18T19:23:58  <cosmo> but i'd be down to pay a portion, techbytes
2014-09-18T19:24:49  <cosmo> also, seems optimal to have DGC added AFTER we go 3.0
2014-09-18T19:25:06  <BittrexBill> you pay .3btc and you get no trading fees for 2 months, you pay 0.5btc you get no tradin fees for 5months ?
2014-09-18T19:25:21  <cosmo> read my mind BittrexBill
2014-09-18T19:25:36  <techbytes> BittrexBill, it's fine.  We will pay the .3 and you just need to work it out with this angry mob...
2014-09-18T19:25:37  <duuuuude> that does seem more faire
2014-09-18T19:25:41  <ahmed_> okay i'd be willing to pitch in 0.05
2014-09-18T19:25:57  <techbytes> that's fine ahmed...
2014-09-18T19:26:16  <techbytes> BittrexBill, send me the address to pay.
2014-09-18T19:26:16  <cosmo> techbytes, .5 deal sounds good. make it 6 months BittrexBill, a solid half year

2014-09-18T19:28:10  <samson_> sure, I'll stick in 0.1

2014-09-18T20:58:20  <ahmed_> duuuuude: there is. you could setup NOMP or just a simple stratum-mining without a db
2014-09-18T20:58:49  <ahmed_> (or a proxypool connected to poolerrangers)
2014-09-18T20:58:57  <duuuuude> i might try setting up my own nomp i tried to send 500mhz to poolranger and it failed
2014-09-18T20:59:58  <ahmed_> i use eloipool myself but xawksow and techbytes use NOMP on the backend

2014-09-18T21:01:36  <duuuuude> it connects, then errors out saying diff is to low
2014-09-18T21:01:52  <ahmed_> for 500MH u need to have an insane diff set
2014-09-18T21:02:20  <duuuuude> what if i sent 5 100mhz workers
2014-09-18T21:02:40  <techbytes> ahmed_ shouldn't it auto set?
2014-09-18T21:02:43  <ahmed_> duuuuude: that'd need a diff of ~1024
2014-09-18T21:02:47  <ahmed_> techbytes: its vardiff
2014-09-18T21:02:52  <ahmed_> it starts low and then ends up high
2014-09-18T21:02:56  <ahmed_> he needs a high starting diff
2014-09-18T21:03:03  <ahmed_> which ends up even higher
2014-09-18T21:03:24  <ahmed_> techbytes: u could edit nomp to setup an extra port for him
2014-09-18T21:03:45  <techbytes> only way is to set up another stratum for high didff?
2014-09-18T21:03:46  <ahmed_> giving a vardiff starting at 1024 and adjusting to something like 5096
2014-09-18T21:03:50  <duuuuude> i gues i could send 10 50 mhz workers if that is easier, iam just trying to test to see if its worth it
2014-09-18T21:03:55  <ahmed_> techbytes: u use nomp on the backend right?
2014-09-18T21:04:19  <techbytes> not for dgc...  i will be switching over when i get a chance
2014-09-18T21:04:39  <duuuuude> i will try sending a 1 worker at 10mhz and see what happens

2014-09-19T01:55:26  <Trenal> or just a site
2014-09-19T01:55:35  <kassado> seems normal for cloudflare
2014-09-19T01:55:47  <kenel> joeyjones, have you tried mod_cloudflare?
2014-09-19T01:55:49  <joeyjones> a site for work
2014-09-19T01:55:57  <kenel> so it doesn't look like 1IP is hitting the site over and over and over?
2014-09-19T01:55:57  <Trenal> turn off cloudflare

2014-09-19T01:56:09  <kassado> bittrex users bitch every day about cloudflare giving them that error and similar
2014-09-19T01:56:18  <kassado> mostly people in places with weird routing

2014-09-19T01:58:11  <joeyjones> kassado: i'm going to give dropping cloudflare a shot
2014-09-19T01:58:33  <kenel> joey jones, does it run into a software that has a backend that uses IP in any way?
2014-09-19T01:59:07  <joeyjones> when pingdom first flagged the incident i saw a massive sysload spike but it then died off
2014-09-19T01:59:30  <joeyjones> kenel: IP being IP address or Intillectual Property?
2014-09-19T01:59:37  <kenel> ip address
2014-09-19T02:00:09  <kenel> i ran into something similar recently where i had to install mod_cloudflare because coming from cloudflare it shows apache it's all from 1 IP instead of who it's actually from
2014-09-19T02:00:36  <joeyjones> kenel: yeah, that's the norm but it shouldn;t cause a random outage
2014-09-19T02:01:16  <kenel> are you tailing the log files when you try to connect and get the 524 error?
2014-09-19T02:01:23  <kenel> sure it's not a firewall issue?
2014-09-19T02:02:08  <joeyjones> kenel: the logs only show 200
2014-09-19T02:02:16  <joeyjones> and it's only some random users that fail
2014-09-19T02:02:36  <kenel> right, but tail -f will just display it live
2014-09-19T02:02:56  <joeyjones> i know
2014-09-19T02:05:03  <samson_> check to see how many open connections you have using this ssh command : netstat -anp |grep 'tcp\|udp' | awk '{print $5}' | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
2014-09-19T02:05:33  <samson_> Sometimes tuning the TCP settings will help - like decrease the timeout values, etc
2014-09-19T02:05:41  <kenel> ah, i didn't think of that
2014-09-19T02:05:44  <kenel> hitting max open connections
2014-09-19T02:06:23  <samson_> Most of the connections will be sitting around doing nothing
2014-09-19T02:06:51  <samson_> A 30 seconds timeout cam TCP timeout and http daemon timeouts are very different things though
2014-09-19T02:07:02  <samson_> *can help
2014-09-19T02:07:06  <kenel> it could also be a bad database code that isn't closing connections, right?
2014-09-19T02:07:11  <kenel> (if it's using a db)
2014-09-19T02:07:43  <samson_> yes but you would get errors logged for that assuming you have mysql error logging turned on
2014-09-19T02:09:08  <samson_> One thing always kills a linux server - zero memory left, connections increasing - swap size growing and load average going from less than 1 to 100 or way more - at that point you need to pull the plug
2014-09-19T02:09:28  <joeyjones> open connections looks sane
2014-09-19T02:09:39  <joeyjones> it looks like removing CloudFlare solved it
2014-09-19T02:09:45  <samson_> number one suspect memory and swap usage
2014-09-19T02:10:02  <kenel> dear god
2014-09-19T02:10:06  <kenel> 28-0 in the first quarter
2014-09-19T02:10:24  <joeyjones> samson_: i always fist check free-m, uptime, and df-h :p
2014-09-19T02:10:27  <joeyjones> *first
2014-09-19T02:10:53  <samson_> I just use the 'top' command
2014-09-19T02:11:47  <joeyjones> -m and -h make it much easier to read
2014-09-19T02:12:06  <joeyjones> and gives a way to check for changes at a glance be re-running a couple of times
2014-09-19T02:12:06  <samson_> I'll try that one day
2014-09-19T02:12:15  <joeyjones> *by
2014-09-19T02:14:16  <samson_> top refreahes every 5 seconds and if it crashes you are left with the last output on the screen which can be useful when you get the SMS telling you to go check !
2014-09-19T02:14:27  <samson_> *refreshes
2014-09-19T02:23:54  <kenel> yeah, i usually use top myself

2014-09-19T04:08:56  <Trenal> same thing
2014-09-19T04:10:14  <kenel> hey trenal, any eta on the escrow?
2014-09-19T04:10:39  <Trenal> When will I host it? Not anytime soon. I can't afford to pay for all the hosting
2014-09-19T04:11:06  <kenel> xawksow can set it up on our poolerrangers vps
2014-09-19T04:11:25  <Trenal> Not sure you understand, each coin needs a daemon
2014-09-19T04:11:35  <Trenal> no reason to have an automated coin escrow for 1 coin
2014-09-19T04:12:02  <kenel> i told you my reason
2014-09-19T04:12:17  <Trenal> Here is an escrow with 2 coins!
2014-09-19T04:13:46  <Trenal> I'll work with him and send him the code
2014-09-19T04:14:52  <TTsquared> Trenal, is the escrow an extension of the online wallet or something different?
2014-09-19T04:15:09  <Trenal> Completely separate for now
2014-09-19T04:15:15  <Trenal> but I'll use the wallet base code to build a new escrow
2014-09-19T04:15:29  <TTsquared> Still working on the wallet?
2014-09-19T04:15:32  <Trenal> I'm trying to finish the wallet layout this week
2014-09-19T04:15:42  <Trenal> and then I'll build an 'installer' package
2014-09-19T04:15:46  <Trenal> so people can use it easily

2014-09-19T04:27:35  <kenel> TTsquared you want me to msg him and see if he's still selling?
2014-09-19T04:28:38  <RunningmanZ> This is his original mywl.lt thread. Trying to see if there are any similarities. But I thought he mentioned before he had about 15 years experience or so like that

2014-09-19T07:05:34  <RunningmanZ> Everyone is raving about Elite Dangerous with the Oculus Rift tho

2014-09-19T17:46:03  <duuuuude> yes i was going ot try more hash on the  pool last night but someone keeps coming in right when the diff is about ot go down and blows it.
2014-09-19T17:50:59  <techbytes-lenovo> so you only mine when diff is low?
2014-09-19T17:51:36  <duuuuude> sometimes, or when i feel its going up, the hash is not cheap so i have to choose the right times
2014-09-19T17:52:16  <techbytes-lenovo> oh, you rent?  Thought you own it.
2014-09-19T17:52:31  <duuuuude> if i owned 1gh of scrypt i would feel pretty cool
2014-09-19T17:52:40  <techbytes-lenovo> me too...
2014-09-19T17:52:47  <duuuuude> i am going ot get some asics
2014-09-19T17:53:02  <duuuuude> but i am still calculating if its worth it or just keep renting when i need
2014-09-19T17:53:17  <techbytes-lenovo> it's cheaper in the long run
2014-09-19T17:53:34  <techbytes-lenovo> i just got two zues thunder x3, 28mh x 2
2014-09-19T17:53:41  <duuuuude> yeah, its just i would have to be really on the coins for a couple of weeks to make sure i ROI
2014-09-19T17:53:49  <duuuuude> nice, that is some scrypt
2014-09-19T17:54:01  <duuuuude> i was about ot get a on of those 27mh falcons just ot see
2014-09-19T17:54:07  <techbytes-lenovo> i have spent a lot of money on rental so this is good investment
2014-09-19T17:54:27  <emdes> yeah techbytes-lenovo , better to buy than rent :)
2014-09-19T17:54:28  <duuuuude> so you have done both, is it really better to buy the asic
2014-09-19T17:54:36  <emdes> hehe
2014-09-19T17:55:15  <duuuuude> cause i can usually rent  1ghz for 1 hours for about .015
2014-09-19T17:55:16  <techbytes-lenovo> yes i have rented 500mh to 1gh for coin launch before but that was a big lost...
2014-09-19T17:55:20  <emdes> next time send 1 to me techbytes-lenovo
2014-09-19T17:55:48  <duuuuude> i did it with JBS last time and 10x
2014-09-19T17:55:54  <techbytes-lenovo> emdes, i'm going to be getting rid of my 10 gridseeds and bunch of gpus
2014-09-19T17:56:06  <duuuuude> getting rid of the gpu's
2014-09-19T17:56:12  <emdes> me too, gpu's
2014-09-19T17:56:23  <duuuuude> i feel like they are going to come back into vogue for a bit
2014-09-19T17:57:45  <techbytes-lenovo> if alts take off again, then it's good to keep them for the x11 or other low power algo.
2014-09-19T17:57:52  <emdes> price for the gridseeds techbytes-lenovo ?
2014-09-19T17:58:36  <duuuuude> ehh, x11 is asics but all the other algos i think are about to get big again, i saw a list being thrown around with all the algos people use, and everyone is going for the non asics
2014-09-19T17:58:37  <techbytes-lenovo> won't be anywhere near where i paid for them, $170 each... i'll be lucky to get $20 for each.
2014-09-19T17:58:43  <duuuuude> like when bitcoins asic first came out
2014-09-19T17:58:51  <duuuuude> what type of cards
2014-09-19T17:59:01  <techbytes-lenovo> gridseed
2014-09-19T17:59:03  <emdes> like $60 new now?
2014-09-19T18:00:09  <techbytes-lenovo> $50 new from zoomhash...
2014-09-19T18:00:15  <emdes> oh
2014-09-19T18:00:21  <duuuuude> you can get gridseed for 40 or 30 most places now
2014-09-19T18:00:31  <techbytes-lenovo> i'm sure
2014-09-19T18:00:35  <duuuuude> i almost got one on cointhrift
2014-09-19T18:00:39  <duuuuude> but i want a little more power
2014-09-19T18:00:41  <techbytes-lenovo> a lot of people getting rid of them
2014-09-19T18:00:58  <duuuuude> oh yeah, everyone upgrading to the cheaper  wattages'
2014-09-19T18:01:09  <techbytes-lenovo> i have 10 in a box with the power supply and all the cables
2014-09-19T18:01:22  <emdes> a dude here trying to sell 11 grids -> $725
2014-09-19T18:01:28  <duuuuude> my electricity is only   .08 so i was thinking of doing a little more mining
2014-09-19T18:01:31  <emdes> with a Pi and some cables
2014-09-19T18:01:41  <duuuuude> with 725 you can buy 48mhz
2014-09-19T18:01:45  <duuuuude> at gaw
2014-09-19T18:01:46  <emdes> I know :p
2014-09-19T18:01:49  <techbytes-lenovo> yeah.
2014-09-19T18:01:53  <duuuuude> people are funny
2014-09-19T18:02:03  <emdes> he said 725 was cheap :p
2014-09-19T18:02:09  <emdes> because of shipping and stuff :P
2014-09-19T18:02:17  <duuuuude> he has to say that
2014-09-19T18:02:25  <emdes> I know, but still
2014-09-19T18:02:32  <emdes> 725
2014-09-19T18:03:15  <techbytes-lenovo> well, there's a sucker born every minutes... :)
2014-09-19T18:03:17  <emdes> (duuuuude) my electricity is only .08
2014-09-19T18:03:18  <emdes> ONLY?
2014-09-19T18:03:56  <duuuuude> yes i thought the was cheaper then others, i see some people electrical bill and it blows my mind
2014-09-19T18:04:08  <emdes> .04 - .05 here xD
2014-09-19T18:04:14  <emdes> free for me :p
2014-09-19T18:04:14  <duuuuude> not bad
2014-09-19T18:04:22  <duuuuude> not free for me
2014-09-19T18:04:46  <emdes> nop, but .08 = cheap :)
2014-09-19T18:05:32  <duuuuude> but i just bought my own place, so i have been really able to reduce the electrical usaage, i have been mining a bit, but only spend like 38$ a month in electricity
2014-09-19T18:05:52  <emdes> yeah thats nothing
2014-09-19T18:06:10  <duuuuude> yeah i think i could double my usage and it still wouldnt be to crazy

2014-09-19T21:00:19  <Trenal> Shadowbane you had to time it with server reboots

2014-09-19T22:12:49  <Trenal> You do deck work or just landscape?
2014-09-19T22:13:01  <kenel-work2> landscape and hardscape, no decks
2014-09-19T22:13:11  <kenel-work2> you find a landscaper that does decks or fences or driveways, run the other way
2014-09-19T22:13:48  <Trenal> I got quoted for $12 a sq foot
2014-09-19T22:13:57  <Trenal> for a small deck, guess I'm building it myself
2014-09-19T22:13:58  <kenel-work2> for composite?
2014-09-19T22:14:02  <Trenal> wood
2014-09-19T22:14:13  <kenel-work2> that's what i install holland stone bricks at
2014-09-19T22:16:08  <Trenal> I'm sure his work is 3x better than mine
2014-09-19T22:16:15  <Trenal> but $500 for a nice deck if I build it myself
2014-09-19T22:16:18  <Trenal> seems a lot more appealing
2014-09-19T22:16:27  <Trenal> espeically since I'm just building it to help sell in the near future
2014-09-19T22:17:24  <Trenal> and my house is barely worth what I paid for it, so any improvements I make are just to help sell not make more money

2014-09-20T19:58:59  <Dreday00> yeah
2014-09-20T20:00:17  <xawksow> okay. :>
2014-09-20T20:00:53  <techbytes-lenovo> hey CoHe
2014-09-20T20:01:04  <xawksow> I'll join the dgc x11 mining with 5 r9 280x. :p
2014-09-20T20:01:43  <xawksow> curious what hash i will get on windows
2014-09-20T20:01:47  <xawksow> wasn't that bad on debian
2014-09-20T20:02:34  <Dreday00> how did you set it up on deb?
2014-09-20T20:02:44  <Dreday00> did you have a hardtime with drivers?
2014-09-20T20:03:51  <xawksow> no not really, just used the ones amd is offering for download
2014-09-20T20:04:06  <xawksow> was pretty straight forward
2014-09-20T20:06:31  <xawksow> you just need then to compile sgminer and be sure to detach every monitor -> restart -> start mining. otherwise the gpu with monitor attached won'T be recognized
2014-09-20T20:06:55  <xawksow> that took me the longest time to find out
2014-09-20T20:06:57  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-20T20:06:57  <Dreday00> Hmmm
2014-09-20T20:07:18  <Dreday00> raspberry is cool
2014-09-20T20:07:27  <xawksow> it is
2014-09-20T20:07:43  <Dreday00> I'm using hashra
2014-09-20T20:07:50  <CoHe> So here is where all the action is!
2014-09-20T20:07:57  <Dreday00> the reading is off though
2014-09-20T20:08:09  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-20T20:08:10  <xawksow> yea!
2014-09-20T20:08:12  <Dreday00> it says im doing 19 Mhs
2014-09-20T20:08:45  <xawksow> hashra is a cloud mining service
2014-09-20T20:08:46  <xawksow> or what
2014-09-20T20:09:24  <Dreday00> they do that but they have and img for the Rasbberry
2014-09-20T20:09:39  <xawksow> oh ok
2014-09-20T20:09:39  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-20T20:09:43  <xawksow> didn't know about that
2014-09-20T20:10:13  <xawksow> well, i used the debian standard iso for everything. but not on a raspbery, as i don't have one. :s

2014-09-21T04:49:04  <kenel> busy as shit; tired as fuck; playing some destiny until i can't see the screen anymore ;\
2014-09-21T04:59:48  <Scrappy_D0> lol

2014-09-21T05:59:34  <Trenal> I shattered tempered glass into a million pieces outside and have to clean it up? that is tiring as fuck
2014-09-21T05:59:40  <Trenal> if it makes anyone feel better
2014-09-21T06:00:32  <kenel> yeah
2014-09-21T06:00:48  <kenel> customer day is 'put on a fake smile and act like you love what you do' all day
2014-09-21T06:01:03  <Trenal> what sucks is I was giving it away to my cousin
2014-09-21T06:01:44  <Trenal> so it was being generous that fucked me
2014-09-21T06:01:44  <kenel> i love what i do
2014-09-21T06:01:44  <kenel> don't get me wrong
2014-09-21T06:01:44  <kenel> but dealing with general public
2014-09-21T06:01:44  <Trenal> its all in the fucking mulch and shit outside
2014-09-21T06:01:44  <kenel> (gun to mouth, bang)
2014-09-21T06:01:44  <kenel> oh yeah, good luck cleaning up tempered glass man
2014-09-21T06:01:51  <kenel> that shit is designed to shatter into 100k pieces
2014-09-21T06:02:13  <kenel> it shouldn't be sharp though
2014-09-21T06:02:14  <Trenal> I barely tapped it on the brick outside
2014-09-21T06:02:24  <kenel> so if you till it into the mulch, it'll just go away eventually
2014-09-21T06:02:46  <Trenal> yeah, none of the shards were sharp
2014-09-21T06:03:11  <Trenal> going to try and build a banquette tomorrow
2014-09-21T06:03:13  <Trenal> we'll see how that goes
2014-09-21T06:03:29  <kenel> wtf is a banquette?
2014-09-21T06:03:45  <kenel> oh, trenal
2014-09-21T06:03:50  <kenel> you think that was a pain in the ass?
2014-09-21T06:03:57  <Trenal> bench seating connected to a wall
2014-09-21T06:04:02  <kenel> i was, after 30 hours without sleep, in a new holland
2014-09-21T06:04:07  <Trenal> in a breakfast nook/dining room
2014-09-21T06:04:08  <kenel> picking up/loading salt into my truck
2014-09-21T06:04:13  <kenel> and its was like -20
2014-09-21T06:04:19  <kenel> so the salt froze
2014-09-21T06:04:24  <kenel> big ridge, like concrete on top
2014-09-21T06:04:39  <kenel> i pick up underneath this ridge, and it was too heavy for the machine
2014-09-21T06:04:49  <kenel> so machine leans forward and forward and forward
2014-09-21T06:04:54  <kenel> and i can't stop it (30 hours no sleep)
2014-09-21T06:05:11  <kenel> this ridge goes through the tempered glass and comes like 3 inches from my stomach
2014-09-21T06:05:24  <kenel> shatters everything
2014-09-21T06:05:33  <kenel> i couldn't even break it off with a sledge
2014-09-21T06:05:37  <kenel> that's how hard it was, lol
2014-09-21T06:06:13  <kenel> i think that was the first and only night i've ever sharted my pants
2014-09-21T06:06:31  <Trenal> Id say that is an acceptable response
2014-09-21T06:06:50  <kenel> it's like one of those dreams where you keep falling but never wake up
2014-09-21T06:07:11  <kenel> that's what this was like; slow motion salt ridge that was as hard as concrete coming at me
2014-09-21T06:07:39  <kenel> meanwhile my uncle was in the first bay sleeping ;\
2014-09-21T06:08:15  <kenel> and newholland boxes are roll proof -- meaning they won't crush
2014-09-21T06:08:28  <kenel> guess the didn't think of salt ridges ;P
2014-09-21T06:08:33  <kenel> they

2014-09-21T20:30:41  <cosmo> it is a better system over PoW
2014-09-21T20:32:11  <duuuuude> proof of stake just leads to bagholding

2014-09-21T20:35:52  <cosmo> true
2014-09-21T20:36:06  <cosmo> any coin worth anything will be bagheld though
2014-09-21T20:36:27  <cosmo> as long as PoW rewards are kept it's good
2014-09-21T20:37:08  <duuuuude> i know that POS is more energy effeciant but i just think it leads to bagholding and manipulation, itsharder to manipulate POW
2014-09-21T20:39:01  <cosmo> actually no, not when the network is small
2014-09-21T20:39:01  <duuuuude> i thought you always need less power and less coins to attack a POS then POW
2014-09-21T20:39:02  <cosmo> PoS weakness = market cap (assuming already distributed supply) PoW weakness = network hashrate
2014-09-21T20:39:06  <cosmo> and how many people are in that network, in both cases

2014-09-22T16:07:05  <samson_> What version client did the wallet come from and what version are you using it with now ?
2014-09-22T16:07:24  <samson_> Although I don't believe that should make much difference
2014-09-22T16:07:35  <nathalie20> How to do it? I do not know on that I'm a woman. where to download the appropriate client?

2014-09-22T16:14:51  <samson_> Did the wallet format change a lot between v0.1 and v2 or something ?

2014-09-22T16:15:33  <ahmed_> samson_: it must have
2014-09-22T16:15:44  <nathalie20> Gentlemen, why such an error in a new wallet?
2014-09-22T16:16:16  <samson_> I have no idea - what version of wallet were yo uusing before ?
2014-09-22T16:16:26  <samson_> Were yo uusing the wallet from 1 year ago ?
2014-09-22T16:16:38  <samson_> There have been a few updates since then
2014-09-22T16:16:42  <nathalie20> sorry for my language
2014-09-22T16:20:15  <samson_> I have DGC v0.2 as a windows version
2014-09-22T16:21:16  <techbytes-lenovo> nathalie20, if your wallet is synced, try running "repairwallet" on the console.
2014-09-22T16:21:48  <samson_> a good idea - also a rescan could fix it
2014-09-22T16:22:34  <nathalie20> gentlemen please correct command that I have to type in console
2014-09-22T16:24:33  <techbytes-lenovo> repairwallet

2014-09-22T16:29:35  <samson_> First you need to go to the directory where digitalcoin-qt.exe is located
2014-09-22T16:30:03  <nathalie20> yes
2014-09-22T16:31:11  <samson_> I'm testing this first so give it a minute

2014-09-22T16:31:28  <nathalie20> ok
2014-09-22T16:32:43  <samson_> I suggest trying the rescan first - this has worked for me serveral times in the past :
2014-09-22T16:33:03  <samson_> digitalcoin-qt.exe -rescan
2014-09-22T16:33:34  <samson_> This will do a full scan of the blockchain that you're already downloaded as the client loads - it will take a lot longer to load due to this
2014-09-22T16:34:11  <techbytes-lenovo> repairwallet would be a quick try as it takes a few seconds.
2014-09-22T16:34:28  <samson_> If that doesn't work then make sure you have a backup of the wallet file and do the -repairwallet version like techbytes suggested
2014-09-22T16:35:02  <samson_> I avoid repairwallet in case it damages something - while rescan doesn't touch the wallet itself
2014-09-22T16:35:17  <samson_> Maybe that's just me being cautious though
2014-09-22T16:35:31  <nathalie20> where do I enter these commands?
2014-09-22T16:36:00  <samson_> I told you above
2014-09-22T16:36:22  <samson_> You need to go to the location where the digitalcoin-qt.exe file is located at in the command prompt
2014-09-22T16:36:43  <samson_> Or you can edit the link from the menus - depends how fluent you are with windows
2014-09-22T16:37:48  <samson_> do you know the location of the .exe file ?
2014-09-22T16:38:04  <nathalie20> yes yes
2014-09-22T16:38:16  <samson_> ok, open command prompt and cd into that directoru
2014-09-22T16:38:22  <samson_> then enter the command
2014-09-22T16:39:12  <nathalie20> open command prompt?
2014-09-22T16:39:31  <samson_> yes
2014-09-22T16:39:38  <samson_> The black DOS like window
2014-09-22T16:39:58  <Rickus_> Like a DOS.
2014-09-22T16:40:10  <Rickus_> erk, that was a bad joke.
2014-09-22T16:40:15  <samson_> click start and enter 'cmd' in the search area - at the top will be cmd.exe - click it
2014-09-22T16:40:47  <nathalie20> ok
2014-09-22T16:41:03  <samson_> so you now have a black window on your screen ?
2014-09-22T16:41:10  <nathalie20> I have a cmd
2014-09-22T16:41:22  <samson_> ok do you know how to change directories in this ?
2014-09-22T16:41:45  <nathalie20> no :/
2014-09-22T16:41:53  <samson_> that's ok because I do
2014-09-22T16:41:56  <samson_> type this
2014-09-22T16:41:58  <samson_> cd \
2014-09-22T16:42:01  <samson_> then press enter
2014-09-22T16:42:31  <samson_> it should now show you a prompt of C:\>
2014-09-22T16:42:37  <nathalie20> yes
2014-09-22T16:42:41  <samson_> ok
2014-09-22T16:42:57  <samson_> This is where you need to know where you installed DGC when you first installed it
2014-09-22T16:43:10  <samson_> we need to change into that directory
2014-09-22T16:44:00  <samson_> it might be several levels deep so we can just do them one at a time if needed
2014-09-22T16:44:29  <nathalie20> what do I do next?
2014-09-22T16:44:48  <samson_> Tell me where you installed DGC and I'll tell you what CD command to use
2014-09-22T16:45:19  <samson_> If you put it in c:\DGC then yo uwould need to start by typing this command : cd dgc
2014-09-22T16:45:36  <samson_> of course it could be in any directory you chose to install it in
2014-09-22T16:46:09  <nathalie20> installed? As for exe file? or of a folder with a folder blockchain and others?
2014-09-22T16:46:18  <samson_> The folder with the .exe
2014-09-22T16:46:23  <nathalie20> ok wait
2014-09-22T16:46:31  <samson_> We want to run the .exe file but with a different command on the end of it

2014-09-22T16:51:09  <nathalie20> ok
2014-09-22T16:51:44  <samson_> so cd \dirname\dirname\dirname\dirname etc

2014-09-22T16:57:35  <techbytes-lenovo> missing "cd"
2014-09-22T16:57:40  <techbytes-lenovo> without the quotes
2014-09-22T16:57:48  <samson_> It should be all on one line - cd followed by the path
2014-09-22T16:59:19  <nathalie20> cd? where it is to be typed cd?
2014-09-22T16:59:30  <samson_> in the command prmpt window
2014-09-22T16:59:37  <samson_> cd means change directory
2014-09-22T16:59:49  <samson_> so this :
2014-09-22T16:59:51  <samson_> cd users
2014-09-22T16:59:58  <samson_> would change you into the users directory
2014-09-22T17:00:41  <samson_> then 'cd pawel' would change you into the pawel dub directory of users
2014-09-22T17:02:33  <nathalie20> or can someone show me the screenshot?

2014-09-22T17:20:10  <samson_> You should not have it loaded when doing this
2014-09-22T17:20:55  <samson_> close the program before running it - forgot to mention that
2014-09-22T17:21:30  <samson_> it should have asked you to press any key to continue anyway
2014-09-22T17:21:32  <nathalie20> Can someone send me the stock exchange Bittrex 3200 DGC. And I will send wallet.dat and password. in the wallet is the 3400-3500 DGC
2014-09-22T17:22:05  <samson_> Why don't you just fix it
2014-09-22T17:23:07  <techbytes-lenovo> nathalie20, since you are now in the right directory, type:  digitalcoin-qt.exe -rescan
2014-09-22T17:23:15  <samson_> Was DGC running on your computer when you ran that script ?
2014-09-22T17:23:16  <samson_> You're like 2 minutes away from having this fixed
2014-09-22T17:25:51  <nathalie20> gentlemen do not know what you mean how do I do or what I have to enable, for me it is black magic
2014-09-22T17:26:04  <samson_> Bullshit
2014-09-22T17:26:12  <samson_> I don't believe you at this stage
2014-09-22T17:26:21  <nathalie20> wallet mintcoin running after half a year there is no such thing
2014-09-22T17:26:26  <samson_> That cmd file does the trick
2014-09-22T17:26:43  <techbytes-lenovo> then email me the wallet.dat and password and i'll send you the dgc after recovering it.
2014-09-22T17:27:10  <nathalie20> lenovo no
2014-09-22T17:27:27  <samson_> So yo uwant someone here to send you some money ?
2014-09-22T17:28:01  <techbytes-lenovo> then good luck getting it any other ways...
2014-09-22T17:28:02  <nathalie20> You are the developers DGC?
2014-09-22T17:28:11  <samson_> No
2014-09-22T17:28:42  <nathalie20> and where is the owner of DGC?
2014-09-22T17:28:49  <samson_> There is no owner
2014-09-22T17:29:03  <samson_> as a coinholder we are the owners

2014-09-22T17:31:28  <Eli0t> do you have to unlock the wallet before rescan?
2014-09-22T17:31:30  <nathalie20> Why do I have to lose your mistakes? then developers are guilty of the loss of my coins
2014-09-22T17:31:39  <Rickus_> ?!
2014-09-22T17:31:58  <techbytes-lenovo> are you still in the DOS window?
2014-09-22T17:32:02  <samson_> If you send them to techbytes he will buy them off you - he's trustable
2014-09-22T17:32:11  <samson_> The DOS window is not in the correct directory
2014-09-22T17:32:11  <techbytes-lenovo> one last try

2014-09-22T17:32:37  <samson_> ah ok
2014-09-22T17:33:01  <techbytes-lenovo> or if you want to do rescan first type:  digitalcoin-qt -rescan
2014-09-22T17:33:02  <samson_> you don't need the password for an encrypted wallet to do a rescan
2014-09-22T17:33:26  <nathalie20> I have no windows ddos.

2014-09-22T17:40:43  <nathalie20> ?
2014-09-22T17:40:57  <techbytes> wallet should not be running
2014-09-22T17:41:13  <nathalie20> ok
2014-09-22T17:44:13  <nathalie20> when I entered the command wallet is turned on
2014-09-22T17:44:28  <samson_> well exit the wallet before entering it
2014-09-22T17:44:31  <techbytes> yes and it will run the repair.
2014-09-22T17:44:48  <techbytes> she meant wallet started up when running the command
2014-09-22T17:45:01  <techbytes> now check the wallet balance
2014-09-22T17:45:09  <samson_> Ok I see - techbytes - do you need to run a rescan after a repair as well ?
2014-09-22T17:45:18  <samson_> or do is it do it all in one ?
2014-09-22T17:45:32  <samson_> Or does it do it all in one - my typing is bad today !
2014-09-22T17:45:44  <techbytes> if balance is there then you don't have to rescan.
2014-09-22T17:46:15  <techbytes> if it's still unconfirmed then run the -rescan
2014-09-22T17:46:17  <nathalie20> I still have not confirmed :(
2014-09-22T17:46:36  <samson_> exit wallet and run again with -rescan this time instead of -repair
2014-09-22T17:46:38  <techbytes> ok, disable or exit out of waller
2014-09-22T17:46:40  <techbytes> wallet
2014-09-22T17:46:48  <nathalie20> ok
2014-09-22T17:46:56  <nathalie20> next ?
2014-09-22T17:47:13  <samson_> digitalcoin-qt -rescan
2014-09-22T17:50:43  <samson_> did you enter the command above ?

2014-09-22T17:50:53  <nathalie20> Are now the wallet had turn on?
2014-09-22T17:51:06  <nathalie20> or no ?
2014-09-22T17:51:10  <samson_> What do you mean
2014-09-22T17:51:24  <techbytes> it will once it finish with the rescan
2014-09-22T17:51:26  <samson_> When I saod 'exit wallet and run again with -rescan this time instead of -repair' I meant it
2014-09-22T17:51:37  <samson_> you need to exit DGC before running this command
2014-09-22T17:51:42  <nathalie20> yes
2014-09-22T17:51:52  <samson_> then when you run the command it will load DGC again
2014-09-22T17:52:23  <samson_> but the notice in the center of the screen will tell you that it's doing a rescan - it will take a few minutes depending how fast your computer is
2014-09-22T17:52:53  <nathalie20> yes but if after entering the command and press enter
2014-09-22T17:53:01  <techbytes> you will see the digitalcoin splash screen only during the rescan.  When rescan finish running wallet will open.
2014-09-22T17:54:01  <samson_> Yes - that's how it works
2014-09-22T17:54:11  <samson_> What are you seeing - something completely different I guess ?
2014-09-22T17:55:40  <nathalie20> wallet was scanned but not turned on
2014-09-22T17:55:54  <nathalie20> Turn on again
2014-09-22T17:58:32  <samson_> What do you mean not turned on - it always starts up after a rescan
2014-09-22T17:58:33  <samson_> Maybe it's minimised into the task bar ?
2014-09-22T17:58:33  <samson_> so load it and check the balance
2014-09-22T18:00:57  <nathalie20> I am waiting
2014-09-22T18:01:05  <samson_> for what ?
2014-09-22T18:01:15  <samson_> Is it still doing the rescan ?
2014-09-22T18:01:17  <techbytes> rescanning
2014-09-22T18:01:27  <samson_> It can take some time
2014-09-22T18:01:35  <samson_> It's got a lot of work to do
2014-09-22T18:02:15  <techbytes> i started mine a little after nathalie ran hers and mine is still rescanning

2014-09-22T18:52:09  <techbytes> i would try -salvagewallet but wouldn't do it unless you backup your wallet.dat.
2014-09-22T18:52:39  <samson_> I wouldn't do anything to a wallet without backing it up - even using it
2014-09-22T18:52:41  <Eli0t> i dont think it will help if you already have the private keys
2014-09-22T18:52:41  <techbytes> as that option will remove your addresses
2014-09-22T18:52:47  <nathalie20> and what is it?
2014-09-22T18:53:01  <samson_> So these coins came from a pool ?
2014-09-22T18:53:09  <samson_> Did you mine them ?

2014-09-22T19:21:19  <nathalie20> why do you want to tell me that he was a fork? and now I write that there was a fork

2014-09-22T19:22:20  <samson_> I'm talking about the planned fork when the mining rate changed last year
2014-09-22T19:22:36  <samson_> not some malicious event
2014-09-22T19:23:13  <nathalie20> And I ask what about my coins?
2014-09-22T19:23:14  <techbytes> the same time nathalie mine 1025.83 and 1945.09 dgc when prior to that, was only mining less than 2 DGC per payout
2014-09-22T19:24:26  <nathalie20> my login on pool - chmura86
2014-09-22T19:24:58  <samson_> [22/09/2014 23:20] <nathalie20> Can someone send me the stock exchange Bittrex 3200 DGC. And I will send wallet.dat and password. in the wallet is the 3400-3500 DGC
2014-09-22T19:25:29  <samson_> You're trying to sell an empty wallet
2014-09-22T19:26:57  <nathalie20> not. guided it to you to people from DGC. who do not know how to fix their own mistake
2014-09-22T19:27:14  <samson_> You think we made a mistake ?
2014-09-22T19:27:27  <nathalie20> by which I can not take my coins
2014-09-22T19:27:31  <samson_> You're the only one with this issue

2014-09-24T05:13:13  <Trenal> pitt vs tampa is a big one
2014-09-24T05:14:02  <kenel> yeah, but pitt has a lot of injuries and tampa has a new QB
2014-09-24T05:14:05  <kenel> so you have no idea
2014-09-24T05:14:24  <kenel> glennon is the man
2014-09-24T05:14:30  <kenel> but i don't trust them vs. pit
2014-09-24T05:14:38  <kenel> chicago vs. gb is another
2014-09-24T05:14:43  <kenel> gb always destroys us
2014-09-24T05:14:49  <kenel> but the OLINE of gb has been playing terribly

2014-09-24T22:31:37  <ahmed_> man bittrex is a pain
2014-09-24T22:32:01  <duuuuude> trex is alot better then cryptsy atleast
2014-09-24T22:32:12  <ahmed_> duuuuude: depends
2014-09-24T22:32:53  <duuuuude> i dont like the behind closed doors stuff at cryptsy thats all, and cryptsy  is kind of the dump spot for coins now, when a coins get to cryptys that usually means its over
2014-09-24T22:33:01  <ahmed_> true
2014-09-24T22:33:12  <ahmed_> cryptsy does have a lot of the behind of the scenes stuff
2014-09-24T22:33:25  <duuuuude> im sure trex does also
2014-09-24T22:33:29  <ahmed_> e.g. 99% of their staff are cryptsy backroomer's
2014-09-24T22:33:34  <ahmed_> *skype backroomers
2014-09-24T22:33:37  <duuuuude> for sure
2014-09-24T22:33:47  <ahmed_> (i was one of the backroomers)
2014-09-24T22:34:05  <duuuuude> i thought so, just didnt want ot make outlandish claims
2014-09-24T22:34:21  <ahmed_> haha im not even intending to deny it
2014-09-24T22:34:26  <ahmed_> it was a shit time of my crypto life
2014-09-24T22:34:29  <duuuuude> nice =)
2014-09-24T22:34:59  <duuuuude> i started to like you more when you started to help the scifi ex peolple, i think thats cool
2014-09-24T22:35:25  <ahmed_> yeah me and dreamwatcher have started to attempt to get the scifi exchange back again
2014-09-24T22:35:42  <ahmed_> couldnt get anyone to help test the new exchange with a shitty UI
2014-09-24T22:35:54  <ahmed_> so we've been porting the old UI to the new exchange
2014-09-24T22:35:57  <duuuuude> i didnt hear about it till to late, i work alot
2014-09-24T22:36:21  <duuuuude> but its winter time so i have more time to myself, when the next test happens i will def help

2014-09-26T00:59:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they reinvent the wheel by doing manual JSON shit for the API
2014-09-26T00:59:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but then use jansson for the stratum JSON shit
2014-09-26T00:59:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> WHAT THE FUCK?
2014-09-26T00:59:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> the functions used to set options in the UI are not the same ones used to set options in the API

2014-09-26T01:45:38  <IncoherentOrange> Eh, my crypto was sunk once clapy disappeared anyway...
2014-09-26T01:50:34  <techbytes-lenovo> hey IncoherentOrange... hope you didn't lose too much..
2014-09-26T01:51:27  <IncoherentOrange> Not really. I'd always been very small.
2014-09-26T01:51:53  <IncoherentOrange> At peak it'd have been worth 800+, but those days are, well, eight months past.
2014-09-26T01:52:47  <IncoherentOrange> I lost $100 (and so did two of my associates), but another person now uses the GPU, and I have, uh... a little server if I need one.
2014-09-26T01:54:04  <IncoherentOrange> And yeah, long time no see, techbytes-lenovo. Howzit?
2014-09-26T01:55:13  <techbytes-lenovo> same old... you're up to speed on DGC moving to multi-algo:  sha, scrypt and x11
2014-09-26T01:55:52  <IncoherentOrange> I heard a murmur.
2014-09-26T01:56:00  <techbytes-lenovo> you still mining?
2014-09-26T01:56:09  <IncoherentOrange> Nah.
2014-09-26T01:56:37  <IncoherentOrange> Kinda just admitted defeat when Clapy went.
2014-09-26T01:57:04  <techbytes-lenovo> it's not the end of the world..
2014-09-26T01:57:18  <techbytes-lenovo> things will pick up again
2014-09-26T01:57:41  <IncoherentOrange> Indeed it isn't, but I don't have the equipment anymore to make much, not at 27 diff.
2014-09-26T01:58:21  <techbytes-lenovo> diff will only go higher from here on out
2014-09-26T01:58:24  <IncoherentOrange> And my fingers are crossed that Clapy will somehow resurface. Any prevailing theory on that?
2014-09-26T01:59:17  <techbytes-lenovo> if he hasn't come back, don't think he ever will...  everyone is thinking the worst probably happen, something tragic..  but no one knows.
2014-09-26T02:00:07  <IncoherentOrange> Hope he's okay, that he's perhaps in jail or something, anything but dead.
2014-09-26T02:00:25  <IncoherentOrange> Even if he never comes back to us.

2014-09-26T03:07:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> oops
2014-09-26T03:07:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> started too high
2014-09-26T03:07:47  <IncoherentOrange> Curious, what does a 980 kick out?
2014-09-26T03:09:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> IncoherentOrange: not more than my 290X
2014-09-26T03:09:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> that's for damned sure
2014-09-26T03:09:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> if it can break 8MH/s X11
2014-09-26T03:09:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'll eat a rock
2014-09-26T03:10:05  <IncoherentOrange> Apparently it gets 7.1MH on X11.
2014-09-26T03:10:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I get that on 290s.
2014-09-26T03:10:35  <IncoherentOrange> Nice.
2014-09-26T03:10:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but the power advantage
2014-09-26T03:10:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> that is nice on the 980
2014-09-26T03:10:59  <IncoherentOrange> Oh, I'm sure. Probably uses like, two-thirds the power.
2014-09-26T03:11:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 3.6 on a 270X
2014-09-26T03:11:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so 2x270X = 7.2MH/s
2014-09-26T03:12:09  <IncoherentOrange> I want to replace the 660 in this system with a 970.
2014-09-26T03:12:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> IncoherentOrange: I bet I could pull 7.5MH/s or more outta the 980
2014-09-26T03:12:30  <IncoherentOrange> The thing beat OC records on LN2.
2014-09-26T03:12:35  <IncoherentOrange> 2.1Ghz.
2014-09-26T03:12:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Nice
2014-09-26T03:12:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but I mean
2014-09-26T03:12:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> same clocks.
2014-09-26T03:13:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 7.5MH/s out of a 980 at the same clocks as it did 7.1MH/s before.

2014-09-26T03:14:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Wizardry? Nah
2014-09-26T03:14:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Just code edits.

2014-09-26T03:16:58  <IncoherentOrange> Pirate Islands will be interesting, no doubt.
2014-09-26T03:17:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I hope AMD pulls a miracle out of their ass.
2014-09-26T03:18:29  <IncoherentOrange> Could use one. Either way, there are great, competitively-priced GPUs coming.
2014-09-26T03:19:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Indeed
2014-09-26T03:19:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I need a 980 for my lab
2014-09-26T03:19:28  <IncoherentOrange> CUDA?
2014-09-26T03:19:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> or a 970
2014-09-26T03:19:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> yes, all I have now are 750Tis
2014-09-26T03:19:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and an 860M
2014-09-26T03:19:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> besdies AMD stuff
2014-09-26T03:20:30  <IncoherentOrange> I only have access to mid/low-end Keplers and Fermis in the house. I gave away the 7850 that I used to mine on.
2014-09-26T03:20:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Fermi is dead
2014-09-26T03:20:55  <IncoherentOrange> Dinosaurs indeed.
2014-09-26T03:21:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I have 270X, 280X, 290X, and 7950
2014-09-26T03:21:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> my testers have 7850s and 290s
2014-09-26T03:21:30  <IncoherentOrange> I have a 630M (540M) and a 560 around. My computer has a 660, my brother's has a 760.
2014-09-26T03:21:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but I need a 970 or 980
2014-09-26T03:21:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 760... useful.
2014-09-26T03:22:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> still, really want a 9xx card
2014-09-26T03:22:37  <IncoherentOrange> Man, so do I. I'd love some gorgeous supersampled stuff on my single 1080p monitor.
2014-09-26T03:22:55  <IncoherentOrange> And those delicious solid framerates, obviously.
2014-09-26T03:22:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I just want it for compute
2014-09-26T03:23:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol
2014-09-26T03:23:23  <IncoherentOrange> I gathered. Either way, we agree that it's exciting stuff.
2014-09-26T03:23:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> yep
2014-09-26T03:24:33  <kenel> oh hey
2014-09-26T03:24:36  <kenel> IncoherentOrange you're back

2014-09-26T03:25:30  <IncoherentOrange> Heh. How've you been?
2014-09-26T03:28:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> hm, I got an idea
2014-09-26T03:28:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> offer code in exchange for 970/980
2014-09-26T03:28:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ehehehehe
2014-09-26T03:28:45  <IncoherentOrange> Good luck. Maybe you have the talent that someone needs that badly.
2014-09-26T03:29:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> IncoherentOrange: I'm getting paid $1k/mo for other improvements
2014-09-26T03:29:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so...
2014-09-26T03:29:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I think I can swing it
2014-09-26T03:29:17  <IncoherentOrange> Nice.
2014-09-26T03:29:39  <IncoherentOrange> I'm planning to do a BCS when I'm through high school.

2014-09-26T03:29:52  <IncoherentOrange> Bachelor of Computer Science.
2014-09-26T03:29:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ah
2014-09-26T03:29:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I didn't go to college

2014-09-26T03:30:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> out of high school
2014-09-26T03:30:15  <joeyjones> shit
2014-09-26T03:30:32  <IncoherentOrange> I figure I need the structure and the co-op experience. I have a book of C++, but I haven't touched it.
2014-09-26T03:30:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> joeyjones: ?
2014-09-26T03:30:35  <joeyjones> i bought a new desktop that can't support the number of SATA HDDs i have
2014-09-26T03:30:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ouch

2014-09-26T03:31:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But I also want to throw up.
2014-09-26T03:31:22  <Dreday00mobile> Im 32
2014-09-26T03:31:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm not sure which I should do, if any.
2014-09-26T03:31:46  <IncoherentOrange> None or all of the above?
2014-09-26T03:31:59  <IncoherentOrange> I'd pick none.
2014-09-26T03:32:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'll go with none
2014-09-26T03:32:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> since all of the above would be more work for the same result
2014-09-26T03:33:06  <joeyjones> Wolf|WinLaptop: sick or just pukey?
2014-09-26T03:33:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> joeyjones: my BP was low
2014-09-26T03:33:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so I fixed it
2014-09-26T03:33:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> by taking some Midodrine

2014-09-26T21:23:35  <techbytes> there are sites you can do that... but you need to wait until you know what the diff is
2014-09-26T21:25:11  <dreday-000> I dont know much but would it be a good idea to prep for dgc 3.0

2014-09-26T21:53:40  <passipapa> Hi at all!   I have a problem with my DGC perhaps someone can help me . I have over 600 unconfirmed coins in my wallet since last year.
2014-09-26T21:53:54  <xawksow> XD
2014-09-26T21:53:56  <xawksow> hahahaha
2014-09-26T21:54:24  <cosmo> unconfirmed for a year?
2014-09-26T21:54:41  <cosmo> like you sent them and they never arrived? where'd you send them from?
2014-09-26T21:55:05  <passipapa> from a pool
2014-09-26T21:55:46  <cosmo> first possibility is the pool was mining on the wrong chain when DGC hard forked
2014-09-26T21:56:17  <cosmo> thus they were never really valid in the first place, did you get a lot of coins suddenly from mining?
2014-09-26T21:56:38  <cosmo> like, you were mining at a slow rate then all of a sudden a ton started pouring in..
2014-09-26T21:57:35  <passipapa> i mined over 100000 with my rigs
2014-09-26T21:58:16  <cosmo> that's a lot :o over how many days? how much hashrate did you have compared to the rest of the network?
2014-09-26T21:58:41  <cosmo> ah, if those confirmed and are spendable i guess that's all that matters
2014-09-26T21:59:41  <passipapa> i mine from the first day of dgc
2014-09-26T22:02:29  <xawksow> 100k is quite much :p
2014-09-26T22:02:47  <cosmo> how much hashpower are your rigs passipapa?
2014-09-26T22:04:51  <passipapa>  8mh/s on gpu but now i swich the coin
2014-09-26T22:05:27  <xawksow> why do you switch?

2014-09-26T22:26:26  <[DGC]Guest8125> Nice new forum.. I like it... Someday I need to register an account.. Lol
2014-09-26T22:26:41  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-26T22:26:59  <xawksow> why not register now an account? :p
2014-09-26T22:28:12  <[DGC]Guest8125> Need to be at my home PC so I can log my credentials... Too many user/pw's these days.. Now that I can't keep them all the same... I miss those days
2014-09-26T22:29:13  <xawksow> lol i know that problem.
2014-09-26T22:29:20  <[DGC]Guest8125> Will there ever be a "Coinbase/Circle/Celery" of DGC?
2014-09-26T22:30:12  <xawksow> sure, why not. can't tell you when, but i think it will.
2014-09-26T22:30:54  <Rickus_> just store your passwords on the cloud, it'll be safe.
2014-09-26T22:30:59  <xawksow> lolo
2014-09-26T22:30:59  <Rickus_> :P
2014-09-26T22:32:32  <[DGC]Guest8125> No clue of how many regulation hurdles they would need to jump thru, but if those companies could come out with their own Credit card that uses btc/dgc on the backend,.. That'd be nice also,... Till the world fully adopts to digital currencies...
2014-09-26T22:32:51  <xawksow> yea, totally agree with that
2014-09-26T22:33:08  <[DGC]Guest8125> Lol,.. I keep'em in a truecrypt file
2014-09-26T22:36:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I might stack some DGC when it goes to X11
2014-09-26T22:38:40  <[DGC]Guest8125> So wits with this DGC 3.0? I can throw my little 333 Mhs asic at it eventually?

2014-09-26T23:00:16  <cosmo> they complain where's my money, no better than a wife
2014-09-26T23:00:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: but you pay them, and they leave
2014-09-26T23:00:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> unlike a wife
2014-09-26T23:00:46  <cosmo> lol
2014-09-26T23:00:52  <cosmo> but then you go and get them back anyway
2014-09-26T23:01:02  <cosmo> perhaps it is me that is out of line
2014-09-26T23:01:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: but only when you need them :3
2014-09-26T23:01:19  <cosmo> also nice desktop wolf :p

2014-09-26T23:02:37  <cosmo> ahmed_ how far along is 3.0?
2014-09-26T23:03:16  <cosmo> was samson in charge of the data storage work?
2014-09-26T23:03:31  <cosmo> maybe we should throw together one of those derpy roadmaps

2014-09-26T23:03:56  <ahmed_> and im in charge of fixing any bugs/getting my shit together before i go to vegas
2014-09-26T23:04:12  <cosmo> could we push the multi-algo update now if we wanted?
2014-09-26T23:05:10  <ahmed_> we could but i wont
2014-09-26T23:05:24  <ahmed_> i'd like everything done in 1 hard fork rather than multiple ones later down the road
2014-09-26T23:05:57  <cosmo> yeah, just saying we need to set a schedule of some kind so everything isn't up in the air
2014-09-26T23:06:29  <cosmo> give people a reason to keep watching, instead of hanging around, seeing nothing happen (lol) then forget us
2014-09-26T23:06:30  <ahmed_> the multi-algo and digishield fork is done, and practically tested already
2014-09-26T23:06:34  <cosmo> or maybe that's not a problem :p
2014-09-26T23:06:43  <CptSoloMiner> ohh ahmed in Vegas, yikes
2014-09-26T23:06:52  <ahmed_> it just needs to be tested with a lot more hashrate rather than the measly crap we have atm
2014-09-26T23:06:55  <CptSoloMiner> good thing Tom moved away from there last year
2014-09-26T23:07:04  <CptSoloMiner> the place is going to be a crater

2014-09-26T23:18:28  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-26T23:18:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> xawksow: kernel is custom
2014-09-26T23:18:40  <CptSoloMiner> I bought a used one for $2
2014-09-26T23:18:48  <CptSoloMiner> and copied it onto
2014-09-26T23:19:04  <CptSoloMiner> same size, just newer and different brand
2014-09-26T23:23:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I have my porn on a RAID 1 on 2x3TB WD Caviar Blacks
2014-09-26T23:24:25  <xawksow> lol
2014-09-26T23:24:26  <xawksow> xD
2014-09-26T23:24:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> encrypted, of course
2014-09-26T23:24:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> except what's on the laptop
2014-09-26T23:25:25  <cosmo> 6 terabytes?
2014-09-26T23:26:46  <xawksow> 3tb
2014-09-26T23:26:50  <xawksow> raid 1 is mirror
2014-09-26T23:27:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> yep
2014-09-26T23:27:34  <xawksow> so if one hdd gets damaged he still got a working one and can watch his porn
2014-09-26T23:27:36  <xawksow> :p
2014-09-26T23:28:52  <Wolf`> yep
2014-09-26T23:29:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and recover it
2014-09-26T23:29:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> replacing the second drive in the array
2014-09-26T23:29:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and rebuilding
2014-09-26T23:29:59  <xawksow> :>
2014-09-26T23:36:38  <samson_> If the raid rebuild fails due to further disk errors on the 'good' disk you can start over and restore from the backup of the raid array
2014-09-26T23:37:00  <samson_> raid rebuilds fail all the time

2014-09-27T21:23:51  <Wolf`> I am just not feeling it yet
2014-09-27T21:24:46  <Wolf`> I estimate another 10% on X11
2014-09-27T21:24:55  <Wolf`> at least
2014-09-27T21:27:26  <Wolf`> so 6.075MH/s per 280X
2014-09-27T21:28:07  <Wolf`> 5.6MH/s per 7950

2014-09-27T21:42:36  <Wolf`> If I do the mod I'm thinking of
2014-09-27T21:42:51  <Wolf`> I estimate the hash rate will go to about 6.075MH/s X11 per 280X

2014-09-27T21:58:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'll have to mod SGMiner itself
2014-09-27T21:58:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and the code for SGMiner is HORRID
2014-09-27T21:59:42  <joeyjones> Wolf|WinLaptop: i'm not surprised.  A lot of cyrpto-related code is spaghetti
2014-09-27T22:00:02  <Wolf`> it's not crypto
2014-09-27T22:00:08  <Wolf`> almost all the crypto is in the .cl files
2014-09-27T22:00:12  <Wolf`> and yes, it's bad
2014-09-27T22:00:21  <Wolf`> but the GPU control code and API code is FAR worse
2014-09-27T22:01:05  <Wolf`> I mean, there are different functions used to change settings - one set is used by the API, the other set is used by the UI
2014-09-27T22:01:32  <Wolf`> jansson is used for JSON handling with Stratum, but the wheel is re-invented for the API - EVEN THOUGH JANSSON IS AVAILABLE
2014-09-27T22:01:45  <Wolf`> This dude just beat off into a text editor

2014-09-27T22:06:50  <Wolf`> Rejects are kinda high right now, but it's luck, as she's been running for only 30min. Average reject rate per GPU is under 1%, except the 280X, which usually stays under 2% - possibly because she's at the ragged edge of stability at 1165/1500
2014-09-27T22:17:22  <joeyjones> Wolf`: i meant crypto currency code, not crypto in general

2014-09-28T01:27:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> if you spend all your time making money - and not enjoying it - it's worthless
2014-09-28T01:28:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so you need to split time between making life better and enjoying the fruits of your work

2014-09-28T02:07:24  <Wolf`> just not stably

2014-09-28T02:09:49  <Wolf`> stability is what I'm looking for, though - and temps

2014-09-28T02:11:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Could probably pull 8100
2014-09-28T02:12:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 1085 and she'll probably hit 89 - 90C
2014-09-28T02:12:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> which is as high as I'll go
2014-09-28T02:12:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> probably good for 8150 - 8200

2014-09-28T23:37:03  <joeyjones> oh
2014-09-28T23:37:06  <joeyjones> just lol
2014-09-28T23:37:07  <joeyjones>  sorry
2014-09-28T23:40:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> hey, all
2014-09-28T23:40:30  <xawksow> sup
2014-09-28T23:40:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> not much, just tweaking code.
2014-09-28T23:41:12  <joeyjones> so, i jsut came up with an interesting idea for a project but it's likely not legal
2014-09-28T23:41:21  <joeyjones> damn laws getting in the way!
2014-09-28T23:41:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> joeyjones: So?
2014-09-28T23:42:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Just don't get caught.
2014-09-28T23:42:27  <joeyjones> it's a website, so it would be pretty public
2014-09-28T23:43:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> joeyjones: I'm a member of a website whose sole purpose is to sell content that is illegal everywhere in the UK.
2014-09-28T23:43:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Although I'm in the US
2014-09-28T23:43:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so I don't care! :D
2014-09-28T23:43:27  <joeyjones> this would be running local, so...
2014-09-28T23:43:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> oh, lol
2014-09-28T23:43:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Well, you could always host it offshore
2014-09-28T23:45:15  <joeyjones> i have 2 ideas, 1 much more likely to be legal
2014-09-28T23:45:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Hm... no matter what optimizations I make (almost), Pitcairn - the chip in 78xx, 270, and 270X, does an excellent job of not giving a fuck.
2014-09-28T23:46:05  <joeyjones> 1) online sale of premium whisky within the province, primarily re-bottled to sampler sizes and theme packs
2014-09-28T23:46:57  <joeyjones> 2) an online user to user dram exchange handling listing and payments as well as selling varrying sizes of sampler bottles
2014-09-28T23:47:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ugh, physical goods. Tricky
2014-09-28T23:48:04  <joeyjones> the second one would be hands-off of the goods
2014-09-28T23:49:55  <joeyjones> and could even go to a classifieds system, but i would like to look at handling the funds so that the transaction si smoother for the user
2014-09-28T23:50:33  <joeyjones> btw, local liquor laws are crazy complex
2014-09-28T23:51:16  <joeyjones> selling online direct would likely require a ton of licenses, and a liquor license is almost impossible to get for a bar or liquor store, let alone for something online

2014-09-28T23:56:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> meh
2014-09-28T23:56:49  <Dreday00_> is there an launch date on tha new algos?
2014-09-28T23:57:55  <Dreday00_> Wollf probably got that 290x to 10 =mh
2014-09-28T23:58:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I hit 9MH/s
2014-09-28T23:58:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but it didn't work
2014-09-28T23:58:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol
2014-09-28T23:58:18  *** ahmed_ is now known as ahmed_ZzZz
2014-09-28T23:58:56  <Dreday00_> I would do water cooling if it meant 5mh extra
2014-09-28T23:59:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Dreday00_: Nah, I can reduce the memory accesses
2014-09-28T23:59:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then downlclock the fuck out of the memory
2014-09-28T23:59:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *downclock
2014-09-28T23:59:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> to save power and heat :3
2014-09-29T00:00:04  <Dreday00_> I read that x11 didnt touch memory as much as scrypt
2014-09-29T00:00:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> not nearly as much
2014-09-29T00:00:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but thanks to the idiots who wrote it
2014-09-29T00:00:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it does at least 4x more memory accesses than it needs to
2014-09-29T00:00:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> AT LEAST
2014-09-29T00:02:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Then you have the really dumb shit
2014-09-29T00:02:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> like putting constants in variables so that you can use a macro instead of normal code
2014-09-29T00:02:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and the original author seemed deathly afraid of arrays
2014-09-29T00:02:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> causing constants to be put in GPU registers, destroying parallelism lol
2014-09-29T00:07:28  <xawksow> that is interesting
2014-09-29T00:07:29  <xawksow> :D
2014-09-29T00:08:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> yeah
2014-09-29T00:09:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but, those are smaller tweaks
2014-09-29T00:10:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> the major R & D requires small edits to sgminer - which I'm working on

2014-09-29T00:53:15  <vinje> hopefully it holds the other direction too :)
2014-09-29T00:57:25  <coinz4all_> true,.. i'd be happy if it just came back up to my buy in price...
2014-09-29T00:58:45  <coinz4all_> not that its like i'm unhappy now,.. just i'd be a little more cheerful :D
2014-09-29T01:00:09  <joeyjones> any idea why btc has tanked to badly?
2014-09-29T01:00:10  <vinje> Could be worse.  YOu could have just dumped a coffee in your boonie hat.
2014-09-29T01:00:27  <vinje> having not read anything, i'm guessing China banned it again.  Maybe russia
2014-09-29T01:00:42  <vinje> They do that often
2014-09-29T01:00:49  <kenel> btc is likely tanking because people reading about paypal realize it's not what it was cracked up to be i suppose
2014-09-29T01:01:22  <vinje> No?
2014-09-29T01:01:22  <kenel> don't know, just guessing
2014-09-29T01:02:59  <joeyjones> kenel: that sounds likely
2014-09-29T01:03:32  <joeyjones> it's also been long enough for the hype to have worn off and btc news to be nothing new

2014-09-29T01:43:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I think... I think the "devs" that did the copy paste on X11
2014-09-29T01:43:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ...actually did Shavite right, probably by accident. A 4-way impl can be done, but it's not as good because of the extra calcs needed to access the local memory (which is accessed often)
2014-09-29T01:43:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So... it seems that the optimal method for GPU is also the simplest: a one-way monolithic implementation.

2014-09-29T06:29:24  <joeyjones> i'm in canada so there would likely be a whole heap of laws broken in the process

2014-09-29T06:29:44  <vinje> I finally found Knob Creek out there.  120$ per bottle though >_<
2014-09-29T06:31:17  <joeyjones> vinje: out where?
2014-09-29T06:31:21  <joeyjones> it's $50 here
2014-09-29T06:31:34  <vinje> Queensland Australia
2014-09-29T06:31:54  <vinje> yeah, most I seen it was 68$ at Trader Joes in the states
2014-09-29T06:32:12  <vinje> and i've been looking since I left.  It showed up a few weeks ago :)
2014-09-29T06:32:18  <vinje> And totally not worth 120$
2014-09-29T06:33:57  <joeyjones> i highly doubt it
2014-09-29T06:34:56  <joeyjones> only a truly premium whisly is worth that much of a mark-up by region
2014-09-29T06:35:18  <vinje> Australia marks up everything, then blames it on the source.
2014-09-29T06:35:33  <vinje> too many middlemen here.  It's an actual job i'm sure lol

2014-09-29T16:19:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That's the ASIC game
2014-09-29T16:19:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> each one rapidly becomes worthless - most of the time, any chance you had of ROI was used by the mining company to mine on your ASIC :P
2014-09-29T16:19:46  <techbytes1_> waiting for my email from alpha tech so i can request my refund
2014-09-29T16:20:03  <kenel-work> alpha tech is sending refunds?
2014-09-29T16:20:28  <nearmiss> we're sorry, but your asic is in another castle.
2014-09-29T16:20:34  <techbytes1_> yes.. they are sending out email for that
2014-09-29T16:20:47  <kenel-work> hot damn, i think that's like 3btc i sent them
2014-09-29T16:20:50  <techbytes1_> there was an update about that
2014-09-29T16:20:57  <kenel-work> back when btc was above 700$ :P
2014-09-29T16:21:22  <kenel-work> i don't have any emails from them saying i can get a refund
2014-09-29T16:21:32  <techbytes1_> i sent over 5 btc when it was at $900...
2014-09-29T16:22:08  <techbytes1_> it was posted on their forum
2014-09-29T16:22:08  <kenel-work> last email i have from them is sept 27th
2014-09-29T16:22:26  <kenel-work> are these guys complete morons?
2014-09-29T16:22:38  <kenel-work> they keep referring to their 'loyalty program' as a 'scheme'
2014-09-29T16:22:40  <kenel-work> fucking morons.
2014-09-29T16:22:47  <kenel-work> We hope as many of our customers as possible sign up for the loyalty bonus scheme, and we look forward to receiving your completed application forms within the shortest notice possible.
2014-09-29T16:23:08  <nearmiss> they must have missed a few edits between their internal memo copy and customer release
2014-09-29T16:23:50  <kenel-work> where is this post about refunds? i don't see it
2014-09-29T16:28:06  <techbytes1_> i'm looking
2014-09-29T16:29:41  <kenel-work> ah well, i'm asking them for a full refund (again) anyway
2014-09-29T16:42:31  <techbytes1_> could only find the quote of the update and its partial refund and not full:  https://forum.alpha-t.net/index.php?PHPSESSID=a9ba0e0c8b8cafa5d347831da1efcf22&topic=890.msg6888#msg6888
2014-09-29T16:44:08  <techbytes1_> actually you can email them the request for partial refund..
2014-09-29T16:44:31  <techbytes1_> and all this time i was waiting for their email... duh..

2014-09-29T18:37:58  <emdes> As an artist I want to capitalize directly on my talent and work. I want you and other investor to benefit from my need to bring in "a medium of exchange" so that I can pay my rent. If I use the Dollar I give that power to the state and more so to the banks who take advantage of us all. when I create my coin or use a coin of my choice I claim that power back. The whole point of that project is to illustrate this concept and make it real.

2014-09-29T20:40:44  <emdes> this Rickus_
2014-09-29T20:40:48  <emdes> Since the counterparty wallet exchange is decentralized, I think that it should be resilient to a court order, Counterparty should have no power over my actions. If counterparty can prevent me from offering my coins there, then we need to come up with something better.
2014-09-29T20:40:48  <emdes> It is a very good test case, even if for this only, you should chip in and buy a coin or two and join the party, so we can make it big enough for the Coca-Cola police to show up.

2014-09-30T02:31:28  <Wolf`> xawksow: do what I do
2014-09-30T02:31:42  <Wolf`> I hook up Freya in the kitchen - which has a 20A circuit
2014-09-30T02:31:48  <Wolf`> or I'd be blowing the breaker nonstop
2014-09-30T02:34:29  <kenel> all outlets should be on a 20a circuit
2014-09-30T02:34:36  <kenel> it just depends on how many rooms that breaker feeds
2014-09-30T02:34:49  <kenel> or if it's a stove, fridge, or a/c
2014-09-30T02:35:08  <Wolf`> kenel: Uh... no
2014-09-30T02:35:31  <Wolf`> Households in the USA have 15A circuits as standard
2014-09-30T02:35:50  <kassado> typically a 30A for two outlets
2014-09-30T02:36:03  <kenel> hm
2014-09-30T02:36:07  <Wolf`> kassado: 30A two-pole is used for kitchens sometimes
2014-09-30T02:36:09  <kenel> i guess you're right
2014-09-30T02:36:26  <Wolf`> And 15A @ 120V is fucking pathetic
2014-09-30T02:36:32  <Wolf`> 1800W is just not real enough
2014-09-30T02:37:18  <kenel> eh, i guess my uncle did me a solid then; i just checked my entire garage and most of my rooms are 20A
2014-09-30T02:38:22  <Wolf`> kenel: Yeah
2014-09-30T02:38:43  <kenel> also it was a left over box from mccormick place
2014-09-30T02:38:47  <kenel> thank you corrupt chicago :P

2014-09-30T19:23:53  <cosmo> yell at us more!
2014-09-30T19:24:25  <cosmo> the multi-algo port is complete, needs extensive testing but it works
2014-09-30T19:25:06  <cosmo> samson_ tied himself down with the op_return thing, hey, hey samson_, yeah you
2014-09-30T19:25:13  <cosmo> you're an official now!
2014-09-30T19:25:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: all right
2014-09-30T19:25:46  <cosmo> so yeah, we could push the multi-algo update now if we wanted, we wanna bundle everything in one hard fork though
2014-09-30T19:25:53  <cosmo> but it's all on a volunteer basis so you know.
2014-09-30T19:26:22  <cosmo> but we (well i do at least) want to give ~2 months after the announcement for the actual fork to take place.
2014-09-30T19:26:32  <cosmo> let everyone know so they can mine some DGC and get involved.
2014-09-30T19:27:05  <cosmo> techbytes is going to do a fundraiser which should help gap the interim, and build up funds for some good bounties n such.
2014-09-30T19:27:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Why not do some shit like push it now to a fork?
2014-09-30T19:27:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> errr...
2014-09-30T19:27:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> a branch
2014-09-30T19:27:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> on a testnet

2014-09-30T19:28:09  <cosmo> we've been sitting around so long DGC fell to 1500 sats, two more months aint gonna kill it
2014-09-30T19:28:30  <cosmo> So maybe fork on Dec 1st?
2014-09-30T19:28:34  <duuuuuude> it could, and not only that checkout the hashrate, it needs to increase
2014-09-30T19:28:46  <duuuuuude> if the for is not till dec, i will probably come back then
2014-09-30T19:28:52  <cosmo> and Wolf|WinLaptop good idea

2014-10-01T02:27:51  <kenel> I possibly might have an answer
2014-10-01T02:28:09  <kenel> but not if there's no question because that was a statement
2014-10-01T02:29:08  <Wolf`> I have a shitload of pain
2014-10-01T02:29:25  <kenel> no pain no gain brother
2014-10-01T02:30:11  <kenel> i took a vike and am drinking beer because i'm in a really really really sour mood since this weekend; my liver will hate me tomorrow
2014-10-01T02:30:19  <Wolf`> kenel: I slept wrong
2014-10-01T02:30:27  <kenel> that's the worst
2014-10-01T02:30:29  <Wolf`> turning my head results in severe pain
2014-10-01T02:31:23  <kenel> pinched nerve or something
2014-10-01T02:31:34  <kenel> i've done that by cracking my neck to hard
2014-10-01T02:31:41  <kenel> too
2014-10-01T02:31:52  <Wolf`> same here
2014-10-01T02:35:11  <kenel> shit lasts for like a week too
2014-10-01T02:35:12  <kenel> it sucks
2014-10-01T03:01:04  <zadai> Sorry, on another pc, anyway, i made 4 withdraws from poolerranchers and none have deposited yet, is there a problem with the pool?
2014-10-01T03:02:47  <kenel> no problem with the pool, what is your pool username?
2014-10-01T03:02:57  <kenel> also where are you withdrawing to?
2014-10-01T03:04:16  <kenel> found your username
2014-10-01T03:05:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: read what he said again
2014-10-01T03:05:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> "none have deposited yet"
2014-10-01T03:05:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> He's sending right from pool to xchg
2014-10-01T03:05:38  <kenel> ah, i kind of assumed that but....
2014-10-01T03:06:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> which is almost always a stupid idea unless expressly supported by the pool and/or exchange
2014-10-01T03:07:46  <kenel> zadai, here is the blockchain showing that your deposits were made succesfully to the address you withdrew to: https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dgc/address.dws?D7akDn2iWiycQkyundEJ4TMHZWXwMUaAtF.htm

2014-10-01T03:08:01  <kenel> so if they didn't show up, i would contact your exchange
2014-10-01T03:09:04  <kenel> https://chainz.cryptoid.info/dgc/tx.dws?96804f4b6f34086104b91824a9152f908aa3f4510a44265917c5a5b8068b931c.htm

2014-10-01T03:09:26  <kenel> i do see that they're showing 'not yet redeemed' -- what exchange are you withdrawing to?
2014-10-01T03:10:25  <kenel> if this is a recurring problem, i would suggest either a) changing exchanges, or b) withdrawing to a wallet client instead (i'm making assumptions here based on what you said)

2014-10-01T04:10:46  <kenel> where are you withdrawing to?
2014-10-01T04:11:06  <kenel> i've done ~ 50 transactions out of the pool to my desktop wallet without a problem
2014-10-01T04:11:09  <kenel> (that's why i'm asking)

2014-10-01T04:37:18  <Rickus_> hey guys, I'm trying to make sense of difficulty vs hashrate charts seen here: http://www.coinwarz.com/cryptocurrency/coins/digitalcoin
2014-10-01T04:37:19  <Coine1ius> (Rickus_'s URL) Title: Digitalcoin Mining Info - Digitalcoin Network Info - Digitalcoin Exchange Info - Digitalcoin Charts - CoinWarz Content Type: text/html Size: 11kb
2014-10-01T04:39:48  <Rickus_> When looking at the past 3 months, the hash rate during the month of aug jumped to a steadyish 1.5 to 2 GH. The diff also went up accordingly to about ~17
2014-10-01T04:41:03  <kenel> Rickus_ i think you may have to actually draw some mean lines between those spikes
2014-10-01T04:41:05  <Rickus_> but recently in Sept, the hash rate has been averaging about 2 GH yet the diff is far higher now in the high 20s. Why?
2014-10-01T04:41:31  <kenel> it'll probably look more proper that way
2014-10-01T04:41:49  <kenel> but also, the difference seems to be our spikes (which used to be 2gh/s at most) to 4+ gh/s
2014-10-01T04:42:00  <kenel> DGC3.0 should fix what you're seeing
2014-10-01T04:43:05  <Rickus_> right, because right now, it seems that hash rate spikes increase the difficulty for a loooong time after they've dissipated
2014-10-01T04:43:18  <kenel> yeah, about 108 blocks or so
2014-10-01T04:43:29  <kenel> the difficulty adjustment is one of the things we're working on
2014-10-01T04:43:31  <Rickus_> and that would hurt the miners
2014-10-01T04:43:33  <Rickus_> aye
2014-10-01T04:43:35  <Rickus_> ok
2014-10-01T04:43:42  <kenel> completely understand
2014-10-01T04:44:06  <Rickus_> perhaps that is something to mention on the 3.0 thread?
2014-10-01T04:44:29  <Rickus_> btw, HI!
2014-10-01T04:44:33  <kenel> it is, somewhere, but not the ANN on bitcointalk (if that's what you're talking about)
2014-10-01T04:45:35  <Rickus_> yes, we should emphasis it everywhere (our forums, bitcointalk, twatter, etc)
2014-10-01T04:46:50  <Rickus_> +e
2014-10-01T04:48:35  <Rickus_> btw, you handle bcx really well. I was tempted to rip into him. lol
2014-10-01T04:57:03  <kenel> lol
2014-10-01T04:57:12  <kenel> it takes a troll to know a troll :)

2014-10-02T00:33:03  <vinje> no, just fuck that guy.  I don't give a shit if he attacks the coin.  It can survive or not but fuck him righ tin the face

2014-10-02T05:53:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> vinje: tbh, it doesn't take brainwashing to make them think vegemite is good - just never let them have peanut butter and they will quickly become accustomed to it; then that is the baseline for them
2014-10-02T05:53:55  <kenel> soylent green is people.

2014-10-02T05:57:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> [23:55:24]	kenel	until tomorrow

2014-10-02T05:58:30  <kenel> i've realized that it's hard to be a friend to me for many many reasons
2014-10-02T05:58:38  <kenel> and on the flip side, i don't trust anyone except a handful of people
2014-10-02T05:58:39  <kenel> so it works out
2014-10-02T05:58:48  <Rickus> whatever works.
2014-10-02T05:58:48  <kenel> then one moves across the goddamn mountains
2014-10-02T05:59:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: I was going to make a /very/ off-color comment before I remembered I don't know you all that well xD
2014-10-02T05:59:29  <kenel> haha, make it
2014-10-02T05:59:32  <kenel> you can't offend me
2014-10-02T05:59:55  <kenel> i'm southside irish man...literally nothing offends me unless my wife says it
2014-10-02T06:00:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ehehe, many, many people say that; don't worry, I'll have another opportunity
2014-10-02T06:00:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Last time I slipped, I got lucky
2014-10-02T06:00:26  <kenel> trust me...worst case we beat the shit out of each other, then have a beer and laugh about it
2014-10-02T06:00:31  <kenel> i used to do that every weekend

2014-10-02T06:01:11  <kenel> after plowing for 32 hours straight
2014-10-02T06:01:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I didn't know fluffypony all that well and I cracked a joke that basically... well... said that while he was traveling, his wife was letting their dogs take turns mounting her lol
2014-10-02T06:01:23  <kenel> the sleeping pill wins
2014-10-02T06:01:32  <kenel> hahahahahaha
2014-10-02T06:01:34  <kenel> i own two bulldogs
2014-10-02T06:01:40  <kenel> and my wife loves them more than she does me
2014-10-02T06:01:44  <kenel> so that'd be on the true side
2014-10-02T06:01:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But it fit /perfectly/ in the conversation; I cracked the joke without thinking lol
2014-10-02T06:01:52  <kenel> but one's female
2014-10-02T06:01:53  <kenel> so...weird
2014-10-02T06:02:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: ...

2014-10-02T06:02:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Either that, or you really are cooler than ln2 :P
2014-10-02T06:02:46  <kenel> yeah, i don't give a shit
2014-10-02T06:02:48  <Rickus> that's... improbable
2014-10-02T06:03:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Jesus, you're awesome.
2014-10-02T06:03:10  <kenel> just don't make fun of the foundation members that i like :P
2014-10-02T06:03:18  <kenel> well i like them all
2014-10-02T06:03:26  <kenel> some have witty comebacks, and some are just cool dudes
2014-10-02T06:03:40  <kenel> so don't make fun of any of them except techbytes :P
2014-10-02T06:03:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: I don't know most of 'em - and even if I did, I wouldn't know shit about them xD
2014-10-02T06:04:21  <kenel> i was made fun of growing up my entire life until i hit high school....on the south side of chicago
2014-10-02T06:04:24  <kenel> i have thick fucking skin man
2014-10-02T06:04:34  <kenel> i don't give a shit :)

2014-10-02T06:05:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: I actually don't often make fun of people
2014-10-02T06:05:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's almost always a rare gem of a moment in conversation
2014-10-02T06:05:47  <kenel> you have thick skin because we made you fucking march to territories so you wouldn't bother us vinje
2014-10-02T06:05:49  <kenel> now go back to them

2014-10-02T06:06:28  <vinje> and probably blisters
2014-10-02T06:06:36  <kenel> then 200 years later
2014-10-02T06:06:39  <vinje> lol
2014-10-02T06:06:40  <kenel> or not even
2014-10-02T06:06:42  <kenel> 100 years later
2014-10-02T06:06:48  <kenel> 'oh man, we're so sorry, here, have a casino'
2014-10-02T06:06:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and because of... well, a lot of the things I like, my jokes can horrify even normal-ish folks xD
2014-10-02T06:06:52  <kenel> that's how it all fucking starts
2014-10-02T06:07:00  <kenel> it all fucking starts with white guilt
2014-10-02T06:07:07  <vinje> yeah, once you start apologizing it never stops
2014-10-02T06:07:09  <kenel> sorry vinje, white guilt made you move to aussieland
2014-10-02T06:07:15  <vinje> Australia should have learned from that mistake
2014-10-02T06:07:21  <vinje> lmao
2014-10-02T06:07:46  <vinje> every speech here has to start with "We want to thank the traditional owners"
2014-10-02T06:07:47  <kenel> Wolf|WinLaptop i'm fine as long as i don't open a fox pussy on my office PC with my mom and uncle behind me
2014-10-02T06:07:47  <kenel> lol
2014-10-02T06:07:56  <vinje> mofos only have 1 flipflop
2014-10-02T06:07:57  <Rickus> Kenel: Have you gone to a mainly Jewish high school, when you're German?
2014-10-02T06:08:13  <Rickus> I have. lol.
2014-10-02T06:08:15  <kenel> lol, i went to catholic schools my entire life except college
2014-10-02T06:08:39  <kenel> southside chicago has the highest catholic schools to resident ratio of anywhere in the country
2014-10-02T06:08:45  <Rickus> I was the token Nazi.
2014-10-02T06:09:04  <kenel> did you make the kids get into a circle, throw a bunch of pennies, then make them fight for them?
2014-10-02T06:09:08  <kenel> because i would have
2014-10-02T06:09:10  <Rickus> HAH
2014-10-02T06:10:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Actually - it begins with the oppression. Imagine a large, slowly swinging pendulum. Oppression is all the way to the left, huge amounts of guilt causing double standards that favor the group and basically everybody bowing down to them on the right. Oppression is holding it all the way to the left - once they begin to get rights and shit, then it's basically letting it go. It will...
2014-10-02T06:10:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ...slowly swing far to the right, before again, very slowly moving back to the left, but not as far, over and over, before it settles in the middle, that being actual equality
2014-10-02T06:11:02  <kenel> yeah, that's how american politics work
2014-10-02T06:11:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That's pretty much the sequence of events from slavery to equality, as I see it.
2014-10-02T06:11:15  <kenel> people want it to be in the middle
2014-10-02T06:11:28  <kenel> but they keep kicking the pendulum too far one way then too far the other way
2014-10-02T06:11:39  <vinje> gotta go guys.  Have a good night.
2014-10-02T06:11:42  *** vinje <vinje!~vinje@182.255.97.244> has quit IRC (Quit: Nettalk6 - www.ntalk.de)
2014-10-02T06:11:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Overcompensation - yep
2014-10-02T06:11:50  <kenel> when all they really, truly want is constitutionalism
2014-10-02T06:11:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I think it will eventually settle in the middle
2014-10-02T06:12:03  <kenel> yet they're too stupid to realize that
2014-10-02T06:12:10  <kenel> it won't because of american media
2014-10-02T06:12:14  <Rickus> sure, but often enough, people that are the most outspoken will influence the pendulum to stay on one side faaar too long.
2014-10-02T06:12:23  <kenel> american media can make issues out of the most stupid things
2014-10-02T06:12:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: no.
2014-10-02T06:12:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Don't blame the media.
2014-10-02T06:13:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It is CERTAINLY not their fault.
2014-10-02T06:13:16  <kenel> why not? half of america follows it blindly
2014-10-02T06:13:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Because the fault is with the stupid fucking people
2014-10-02T06:14:04  <Rickus> good luck in changing that.
2014-10-02T06:14:15  <Rickus> Takes generations...
2014-10-02T06:14:35  <Rickus> and in the way we're going, Idiocracy really isn't that far fetched :P
2014-10-02T06:15:00  <kenel> there used to be a time when a journalist would ask people real, tough, hard questions no matter who they were
2014-10-02T06:15:05  <kenel> and they would report the NEWS
2014-10-02T06:15:09  <kenel> that doesn't happen anymore
2014-10-02T06:16:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Yes it does.
2014-10-02T06:16:17  <kenel> who has asked our current president tough questions more than once?
2014-10-02T06:16:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> There was a politician that agreed to an interview with a high school newspaper writer
2014-10-02T06:16:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Maybe 10min in
2014-10-02T06:16:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and I swear to god, I could not make this up
2014-10-02T06:16:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> he said he had to go to the bathroom and never came back.
2014-10-02T06:17:07  <kenel> fine, but that's not what 90% of american people see
2014-10-02T06:17:10  <Rickus> hah
2014-10-02T06:17:22  <kenel> 90% of what american people see are GMA and Nightly World Report
2014-10-02T06:17:24  <Rickus> Future: "Welcome to Costco, I love you."
2014-10-02T06:18:31  <kenel> i'd rather just watch Naked News than what they show on CBS, NBC, ABC, WGN news
2014-10-02T06:19:20  <Rickus> amen.
2014-10-02T06:20:21  <kenel> i mean 1/2 of people under 25 admit they get all of their news/world events/etc from John Stewart
2014-10-02T06:20:27  <kenel> .....
2014-10-02T06:27:30  <joeyjones> kenel: i guess i'm 25 so don't really fall under that but i listen to the radio on the way to work and read hacker mews and google news
2014-10-02T06:27:53  <joeyjones> funny enough i often hear about major world events on hacker news before anywhere else
2014-10-02T06:28:02  <joeyjones> for example the case of ebola in texas

2014-10-02T18:09:54  <Rickus> I don't have a great singing voice.
2014-10-02T18:10:42  <Rickus> what's the difference between bitcointalk and bitcointa.lk?
2014-10-02T18:11:37  <cosmo> probably a lot less spam on bitcointa.lk, i just posted there for added exposure.
2014-10-02T18:12:02  <Rickus> right. Will register there
2014-10-02T18:12:12  <Rickus> I wonder if BCX is there too? :)
2014-10-02T18:12:25  <cosmo> probably
2014-10-02T18:12:35  <cosmo> you can link your accounts between bitcointalk and bitcointa.lk
2014-10-02T18:12:41  <cosmo> i think that's the only way to sign up..
2014-10-02T18:12:44  <Rickus> ah
2014-10-02T18:12:46  <Rickus> ok
2014-10-02T18:31:17  <cosmo> oh lol looks like bitcointa.lk is pretty dead
2014-10-02T18:31:30  <cosmo> the first page of the altcoin section has posts from 2013

2014-10-03T13:24:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> God, this 280X is exceptional
2014-10-03T13:24:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Mining using a far faster, somewhat hotter running, X11 kernel and getting 5.8MH/s or more at 55C - air cooled.
2014-10-03T13:35:21  <cosmo> techbytes says the DGC network spiked to 12gh/s last night?
2014-10-03T13:42:41  <techbytes1_> yes, i was awake when that was hit
2014-10-03T13:42:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> My bad.
2014-10-03T13:43:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I was testing a some scrypt mods on my 290X
2014-10-03T13:43:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> :3
2014-10-03T14:01:18  <cosmo> srsly wolf that was you?

2014-10-03T14:02:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> x3
2014-10-03T14:02:56  <cosmo> no seriously, it's nice to know in case BCX actually does have bite to his bark
2014-10-03T14:02:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> On some real shit though, no way. A GPU simply isn't going to beat any half-decent ASIC implementation of scrypt, no matter how good your code is
2014-10-03T14:03:12  <cosmo> aaaaaaw
2014-10-03T14:03:18  <cosmo> yeah, that's why i asked..
2014-10-03T14:04:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And BCX does have bite to his bark, I think - he just barks one hell of a lot more than he actually bites.
2014-10-03T14:04:44  <cosmo> it is costly to attack a network
2014-10-03T14:04:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Of course
2014-10-03T14:05:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But BCX has money like a national bank
2014-10-03T14:05:37  <moriarty> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUFJLaZ806A - i'd tap that

2014-10-03T14:18:06  <dreday-mobile> i wish i stuck with programming when i was younger
2014-10-03T14:18:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> if you consider shitty little Liberty Basic programming, then I think I started at like 9 - 10, but I was doing C and assembly for operating systems development at 13 or so
2014-10-03T14:19:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Man, reading my old bootloader code... the 15 year old me could kick my ass at x86 ASM now lol

2014-10-03T14:24:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> dreday-mobile: Nah - it's not the soft brain
2014-10-03T14:24:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> His C was slightly subpar
2014-10-03T14:24:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> He just did far more work in ASM
2014-10-03T14:24:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and I haven't since
2014-10-03T14:24:57  <dreday-mobile> i was talking about my brain now lol

2014-10-03T15:07:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Like, way before Bailey Jay was super popular - I /really/ liked her; now everything on her face is plastic, plus the fake ass tits that are too big even if they were real

2014-10-03T16:47:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Hm... I think my life enjoyment would be far more getting something I want for my soul.
2014-10-03T16:47:34  <cosmo> nah without the soul you wouldn't be able to enjoy anything

2014-10-03T23:37:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> My question is
2014-10-03T23:37:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> DGC wants the third alg to be ASIC resistant
2014-10-03T23:38:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'd like to know what they plan on doing when someone makes an X11 ASIC
2014-10-03T23:46:26  <ahmed_> Wolf|WinLaptop: depends really
2014-10-03T23:46:52  <ahmed_> if e.g. the difference isnt all that much between GPU and asic (i do very much doubt that but still) then not much?
2014-10-03T23:47:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It will be.
2014-10-03T23:47:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It will END GPU
2014-10-03T23:47:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Worse than ASIC killed scrypt
2014-10-03T23:47:17  <ahmed_> Otherwise we might try implementing another algorithm
2014-10-03T23:47:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it'll not quite be BTC level of destruction
2014-10-03T23:47:47  <ahmed_> ive been looking at several SHA3? algorithm's which ive been wanting to implement so i'd take a shot at adding one of those
2014-10-03T23:47:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but when an X11 ASIC hits, it's going to hit like a ten ton bomb
2014-10-03T23:48:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ahmed_: There is only one SHA3 - Keccak
2014-10-03T23:48:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> You mean the SHA3 finalists, I assume
2014-10-03T23:48:38  <ahmed_> Wolf|WinLaptop: Yeah one of the finalists

2014-10-04T02:17:31  <Dreday00> yeah

2014-10-04T02:22:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Dreday00: [17:07:05]	Wolf|WinLaptop	Hint: If it has "ASIC" anywhere near it, dishonesty is never (ever) far behind, and outright scam is likely, although not certain.
2014-10-04T02:22:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That, and unless your landlord is paying the power bill
2014-10-04T02:22:53  <moriarty> noobs
2014-10-04T02:22:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they can mind their own or get a new tenant :P

2014-10-04T02:35:23  <cosmo> ah you're right, i thought the U was one of those UK ways of spelling it
2014-10-04T02:37:31  <moriarty> Scrappy_D0, watch them bounce - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2RZXeQc5HU
2014-10-04T02:37:43  <moriarty> cosmo, generally but there are exceptions
2014-10-04T02:37:48  <RunningmanZ> Scrappy_D0:hey whats up
2014-10-04T02:41:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Scrappy_D0: you're rich?
2014-10-04T02:42:08  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, he likes to think he is
2014-10-04T02:42:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Like, 500+ GPU farm rich or Bill Gates, Fortune 500 rich?
2014-10-04T02:42:27  <moriarty> but really, an upgrade from a cardboard box to affordable housing ain't a step up
2014-10-04T02:42:44  <moriarty> i'm on my way to Bill Gates rich
2014-10-04T02:42:46  <moriarty> fuck yeah
2014-10-04T02:43:19  <cosmo> lol you been homeless before moriarty?
2014-10-04T02:43:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: actually, cardboard box to affordable housing would be a massive step up
2014-10-04T02:43:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's about the % increase in quality of life
2014-10-04T02:43:43  <moriarty> cosmo, lol no
2014-10-04T02:43:48  <cosmo> yeah he's insane
2014-10-04T02:43:50  <moriarty> cosmo, but i did kick some homeless bums before
2014-10-04T02:43:51  <moriarty> :)
2014-10-04T02:44:09  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, well, at least you don't get raped in your sleep no more so yeah i suppose
2014-10-04T02:44:27  <cosmo> someday you'll snap and start shooting schoolkids i'm sure
2014-10-04T02:44:49  <joeyjones> lol
2014-10-04T02:44:57  <joeyjones> the install media creation failed
2014-10-04T02:45:16  <moriarty> cosmo, lol nah, i'm too rich for that shit
2014-10-04T02:45:27  <moriarty> cosmo, more like i'd buy schoolkids to wash my car for me
2014-10-04T02:45:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: lol, raped in my sleep?
2014-10-04T02:45:36  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, lol homeless in cardboard boxes
2014-10-04T02:45:46  <moriarty> i imagine being raped is event du jour
2014-10-04T02:45:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> oh, right
2014-10-04T02:46:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I doubt it - I mean, homeless person... let me put it to you this way, moriarty, would you pick up a hooker coming out of a free health clinic?
2014-10-04T02:47:16  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, depends how poor you are
2014-10-04T02:47:21  <moriarty> that's why prostitutes are detested
2014-10-04T02:47:26  <moriarty> not because of any high moral ground standing
2014-10-04T02:47:44  <moriarty> but because most people can't afford to pay for sex
2014-10-04T02:47:53  <moriarty> so yeah, freebies, why not
2014-10-04T02:48:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: Prostitutes are mostly hated because society is still feeling the aftereffects of religion and it's blight upon the state of the human mind
2014-10-04T02:48:17  <moriarty> either you charm your way into her pants with words, or you take advantage of her homeless situation
2014-10-04T02:48:23  <moriarty> agreed
2014-10-04T02:48:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Let's face it: You pay for sex.
2014-10-04T02:48:31  <cosmo> please get a vasectomy moriarty
2014-10-04T02:48:31  <moriarty> pretty much
2014-10-04T02:48:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Either you pay for her food, and her wants
2014-10-04T02:48:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> or you pay her directly
2014-10-04T02:48:45  <moriarty> cosmo, wouldn't you like to see little moriarty's running around raping things and shit?
2014-10-04T02:48:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but you're going to pay for it
2014-10-04T02:48:51  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, so true
2014-10-04T02:48:59  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, we're of like minds
2014-10-04T02:49:04  <cosmo> i've refrained from violence thus far mort, don't push me please
2014-10-04T02:49:42  <cosmo> kinda joking i've detached myself enough not to care how others live
2014-10-04T02:50:00  <cosmo> seriously though make some real friends dude
2014-10-04T02:50:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: lol, I totally want you to have kids - you would make some awesome experiments. Probably would train one from a toddler on to drive, fire weapons,kill effectively, pick locks, etc
2014-10-04T02:50:07  <cosmo> you need em
2014-10-04T02:50:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: Of course, any kid of your would probably end up very, very damaged
2014-10-04T02:50:25  <moriarty> lol cosmo, i'm rich enough, i have enough friends as it is
2014-10-04T02:50:41  <cosmo> can i be your friend :D
2014-10-04T02:50:47  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, lol my toddlers would be slapping babe's asses and shit
2014-10-04T02:50:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But it'd be an interesting experiment that I could enjoy seeing the results of without having to commit such an unethical experiment myself
2014-10-04T02:50:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and lol
2014-10-04T02:50:58  <moriarty> and i'd be like, THATS MY BOY
2014-10-04T02:51:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: that would be the shit, actually xD
2014-10-04T02:51:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Funnier than when a toddler curse
2014-10-04T02:51:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *curses
2014-10-04T02:51:20  <cosmo> if you have kids they'll probably kill you for the quick inheritance
2014-10-04T02:51:21  <moriarty> lol
2014-10-04T02:51:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Nah, moriarty is too smart to leave them enough for that to be worth it
2014-10-04T02:52:11  <cosmo> ha
2014-10-04T02:52:21  <cosmo> blow it all and laugh at em as you go
2014-10-04T02:52:41  <cosmo> 'it was all me motherfuckerrrs'
2014-10-04T02:52:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: sounds likely to me
2014-10-04T02:52:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but even if he did leave something to someone
2014-10-04T02:52:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it would be a small enough amount
2014-10-04T02:53:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so that murder simply wouldn't be profitable with the risk
2014-10-04T02:53:49  <cosmo> yeah if it's willed to someone else i guess that's that for em
2014-10-04T02:53:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I like moriarty.
2014-10-04T02:53:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Well, maybe not.
2014-10-04T02:54:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But I understand him.
2014-10-04T02:54:09  *** snatchmonkey <snatchmonkey!519bcf65@gateway/web/freenode/ip.81.155.207.101> has quit IRC (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
2014-10-04T02:54:22  <cosmo> there's a psychopath in all of us
2014-10-04T02:54:32  <moriarty> lol
2014-10-04T02:54:47  <cosmo> so what would you do with your money after death moriarty?
2014-10-04T02:54:54  <moriarty> that's good
2014-10-04T02:55:02  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop and cosmo are both on their ways to becoming a CEO

2014-10-04T02:55:17  <cosmo> yeah if i could only transmute my own from self-loathing to manipulating the system
2014-10-04T02:55:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: being a psychohpath, also known as a sociopath, is not really anything to be ashamed of
2014-10-04T02:55:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *psychopath
2014-10-04T02:55:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It's not like they all go out and murder people
2014-10-04T02:55:40  <cosmo> that's assuming there's something right about society to compare to :p
2014-10-04T02:55:43  <moriarty> "In what’s been billed as one of the most overlooked books of recent years — “The Wisdom of Psychopaths: What Saints, Spies and Serial Killers Can Teach Us About Success” — author Kevin Dutton finds that CEOs lead the list in terms of most psychopathic persons. That’s followed by lawyers, and then by members of television and radio media, Time reported. Numbers four and five
2014-10-04T02:55:43  <moriarty> are salesperson and surgeon — and then the media makes the list again, with the number six slot held by journalists."
2014-10-04T02:55:54  <Dreday00> what makes you rich moriarty?
2014-10-04T02:56:01  <moriarty> Dreday00, being a psychopath makes me rich
2014-10-04T02:56:07  <moriarty> i see poor newbies scream in pain as bitcoin fall
2014-10-04T02:56:09  <moriarty> and i laugh
2014-10-04T02:56:14  <Dreday00> why
2014-10-04T02:56:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> They are simply more rational than most people, not unlike myself: If they have a goal, they figure out the line that goes from point A to point B.
2014-10-04T02:56:24  <moriarty> because all i hear is, kaching, kaching, kachinga!
2014-10-04T02:56:41  <cosmo> buying or shorting moriarty?
2014-10-04T02:56:42  *** snatchmonkey <snatchmonkey!519bcf65@gateway/web/freenode/ip.81.155.207.101> has joined #digitalcoin
2014-10-04T02:56:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> If you become emotional, you lose it. Things start messing with that bright, clear line.
2014-10-04T02:56:55  <moriarty> cosmo, lol i've dumped all my money in S&P500 and emerging markets
2014-10-04T02:57:05  <moriarty> so far i'm doing 40% this year so i'm pretty pleased
2014-10-04T02:57:08  <moriarty> above my 30% target
2014-10-04T02:57:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Therefore, sociopaths have far less of humanity's largest weakness
2014-10-04T02:57:42  <Dreday00> Nice
2014-10-04T02:57:53  <moriarty> cosmo, so i've got $8 million, 40% would be a $3.2 million profit on paper of course
2014-10-04T02:57:57  <moriarty> but i'm going to cash out soon
2014-10-04T02:58:04  <moriarty> well, i'm in no hurry :)
2014-10-04T02:58:12  <moriarty> i typically adjust my portfolio at the end of the year if need be
2014-10-04T02:58:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Dreday00: But seriously, I'd do GPU mining
2014-10-04T02:58:17  <Dreday00> why do you have so much money?
2014-10-04T02:58:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Dreday00: Because it makes him happy.
2014-10-04T02:58:33  <moriarty> Dreday00, 7 million from bitcoin, 1 million from world cup and scotland bets
2014-10-04T02:58:37  <moriarty> lol Wolf|WinLaptop
2014-10-04T02:58:51  <Dreday00> you had old bitcoins?
2014-10-04T02:58:56  <moriarty> actually it was approaching 2 million from the bets
2014-10-04T02:58:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> He decided he wanted money, thought about it, and then he saw that bright, clear line that led to him getting it
2014-10-04T02:58:59  <moriarty> but i spent some, so it's 1 now
2014-10-04T02:59:10  <moriarty> Dreday00, i traded Q4 last year
2014-10-04T02:59:17  <moriarty> Dreday00, over a period of one month
2014-10-04T02:59:22  <moriarty> best trades of my life :)
2014-10-04T02:59:29  <moriarty> never saw such performance in conventional markets
2014-10-04T02:59:33  <Dreday00> small cap large cap
2014-10-04T02:59:35  <moriarty> i was doing a million percent gain annualised
2014-10-04T02:59:39  <moriarty> i only dabbled in bitcoin
2014-10-04T02:59:45  <Dreday00> pink sheets
2014-10-04T02:59:52  <moriarty> i played with litecoin but it was not liquid enough for that much money
2014-10-04T02:59:55  <moriarty> so i stuck to bitcoin
2014-10-04T03:00:09  <moriarty> oh, generally large, if i'm doing trend overviews
2014-10-04T03:00:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> heh, I know one guy balling more than moriarty
2014-10-04T03:00:12  <moriarty> i don't do penny stocks anyway
2014-10-04T03:00:16  <moriarty> not unless there's a good exception
2014-10-04T03:00:17  <cosmo> moriarty what do you think of this graph http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MK0H1oM5Qqo/UlDjnI30HjI/AAAAAAAAGuQ/SyF4dg7CxCE/s1600/()+Stocks+Long+Term+SandP+500.png

2014-10-04T03:00:19  <Dreday00> I made 17000$ last year on sprint clearwire
2014-10-04T03:00:20  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, lol who?
2014-10-04T03:00:40  <moriarty> Dreday00, nice, what was your initial capital?
2014-10-04T03:00:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: I don't remember if he's ONE of the Imageshack founders or THE founder of Imageshack
2014-10-04T03:00:45  <moriarty> Dreday00, ##econometrics would suit you
2014-10-04T03:00:54  <Dreday00> moriarty you just sat there and sold and bought and sold and bought?
2014-10-04T03:01:03  <moriarty> cosmo, it just tells me there's lots of upside
2014-10-04T03:01:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but yeah, he did that, then did a bunch of trading in the stock market, I think. We met because he's a bit into crypto - has his own farm
2014-10-04T03:01:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> He started GPU mining LTC back in the early days
2014-10-04T03:01:51  <moriarty> cosmo, the two structural breaks in early 2000's and pre-2010's tells you that the market ought to have been higher, but of course the downside is that we're on the lower trajectory that extrapolates from the mid-1990's
2014-10-04T03:02:01  <moriarty> cosmo, of course we all know of helicopter ben and his antics
2014-10-04T03:02:06  <Dreday00> Shit I cant remmeber but I had sprint back when it was sub 3.00 and clearwire was sub $1
2014-10-04T03:02:08  <moriarty> although some would pin it down to as far back as greenspan
2014-10-04T03:02:14  <moriarty> which was responsible for that trajectory shift
2014-10-04T03:02:24  <moriarty> Dreday00, pretty much
2014-10-04T03:02:42  <moriarty> Dreday00, i did a test buy of $100k based on a personal loan
2014-10-04T03:02:48  <moriarty> Dreday00, i got back double, so i repaid the loan
2014-10-04T03:02:51  <Dreday00> OH I see
2014-10-04T03:02:54  <moriarty> and then i flushed the money into half a car
2014-10-04T03:02:58  <moriarty> this was at $200 price level
2014-10-04T03:03:03  <moriarty> so i decided to throw the sink in
2014-10-04T03:03:03  <Dreday00> that was a big bet
2014-10-04T03:03:09  <moriarty> and went fully in at $400 price level
2014-10-04T03:03:26  <moriarty> well, i saw an opportunity and grabbed it
2014-10-04T03:03:36  <moriarty> you can't get opportunities like these often
2014-10-04T03:03:39  <Dreday00> what had you so confident in the market   was it the 2008 crash?
2014-10-04T03:03:41  <moriarty> i recognised such multipliers are not common
2014-10-04T03:03:47  <moriarty> oh i was talking about bitcoin
2014-10-04T03:03:52  <moriarty> you're talking about conventional markets?
2014-10-04T03:04:02  <Dreday00> you bought $100 in bitcoin??
2014-10-04T03:04:05  <moriarty> well conventional markets is a lot less straight forward
2014-10-04T03:04:07  <moriarty> yep
2014-10-04T03:04:09  <Dreday00> $100k
2014-10-04T03:04:14  <moriarty> post-2008, i bought into solar
2014-10-04T03:04:24  <moriarty> so stuff like TSL and ADRs
2014-10-04T03:04:31  <moriarty> and i made some 100% gains there
2014-10-04T03:04:35  <moriarty> annualised of course
2014-10-04T03:04:40  <moriarty> and then i got into gold at the same time
2014-10-04T03:04:47  <moriarty> i got out of gold three years later
2014-10-04T03:04:55  <moriarty> and did 30% annualised
2014-10-04T03:05:02  <moriarty> so that was almost 100% over three years
2014-10-04T03:05:06  <moriarty> basically a doubling of money
2014-10-04T03:05:12  <Dreday00> you gonna get a bond setup and get income off that shit

2014-10-04T10:08:48  <joeyjones> RunningmanZ: it was a wire on a fan
2014-10-04T10:08:56  <joeyjones> and the gpu wasn;t properly powered
2014-10-04T10:09:02  <joeyjones> and it also was fucked anyway
2014-10-04T10:23:03  <RunningmanZ> so the card is faulty?
2014-10-04T10:28:00  <joeyjones> RunningmanZ: the first one is, it sometimes didn;t even display past the boto screen and at other times randomly died after boot
2014-10-04T10:40:15  <RunningmanZ> what types of cards?
2014-10-04T10:40:29  <RunningmanZ> as in which one is not working
2014-10-04T10:40:56  <RunningmanZ> sounds like maybe a power issue if its doing that. Maybe not getting enough power
2014-10-04T10:41:51  <RunningmanZ> can u try the card in another pc or try disconnecting some other stuff and just have the cpu, ram and video card connected and see if it stays on
2014-10-04T10:53:11  <joeyjones> RunningmanZ: Sapphire R9 280X for both
2014-10-04T10:53:31  <joeyjones> the PSU was in my miner, 850w
2014-10-04T10:54:09  <joeyjones> i had it setup with the 6 and 8 pin power cords on the same wire and changed to 2 different wires when i swapped it out
2014-10-04T10:54:52  <RunningmanZ> yeah thats more than enough on that powe supply. Maybe try it in another pc and if it doesn't work on that then its most likely stuffed
2014-10-04T10:55:10  <RunningmanZ> bbl gotta walk the dog

2014-10-04T18:58:08  <Dreday00> heater that pays for itself
2014-10-04T18:58:36  <Dreday00> I figure I can swap the 120mm fan with another better quality one

2014-10-04T19:40:01  <kenel> i hate these bloated clients
2014-10-04T19:40:21  <samson_> maybe, someone will dump it to images and extract the letters frame by frame
2014-10-04T19:40:22  <duuuuude> and you could just digitally fingerprint the video then have a program ahalyze fingerprint then put i right captcha answer
2014-10-04T19:40:28  <kenel> duuuuude i'd imagine you'd need to filter it about 25+ times
2014-10-04T19:42:25  <kenel> anyone want an iptorrents invite?
2014-10-04T19:42:31  <kenel> i have 5 that'll be expiring soon

2014-10-04T19:43:02  <kenel> well, does anyone here want one before i sell them then?
2014-10-04T19:43:20  <duuuuude> yes they have many torrent invites for sale there
2014-10-04T19:43:45  <kenel> i don't think i've been to this place before
2014-10-04T19:43:58  <kenel> a roadster trike? nice
2014-10-04T19:44:03  <duuuuude> it is a good place to buy with cryptos
2014-10-04T19:44:15  <duuuuude> the trike is awesome, and the cessna for 18btc is cool
2014-10-04T19:44:22  <kenel> eh, it's 5$
2014-10-04T19:44:29  <duuuuude> sorry
2014-10-04T19:44:30  <kenel> but if i sold 4 of them, i'd get my donation $$ back
2014-10-04T19:44:41  <kenel> i donate about twice a year to keep my ratios high
2014-10-04T19:44:57  <duuuuude> thats fun i have torrents in over a decade,
2014-10-04T19:44:59  <kenel> netflix plays 24/7 in my house so i don't like leaving shit open too long
2014-10-04T19:45:15  <duuuuude> havnt
2014-10-04T19:45:17  <kenel> my little ponies, daniel tiger, whatever show my wife is into at this point
2014-10-04T19:45:31  <kenel> sometimes have netflix streaming on 3 tvs at once, heh
2014-10-04T19:45:33  <kenel> comcast must hate me
2014-10-04T19:45:34  <Dreday00> sure i'll take an invite
2014-10-04T19:45:39  <duuuuude> yeha i just go to other channels i know, its much faster and safer tehn torrents
2014-10-04T19:45:50  <Dreday00> i dont have cable
2014-10-04T19:46:19  <kenel> i have 3 torrent sites i go to -- ipt, torrentday, and one other one i forgot
2014-10-04T19:47:05  <duuuuude> i like to get stuff before it comes out on torrents, just ot be a nerd =)
2014-10-04T19:47:30  <duuuuude> damn i am sick of waiting for fedex, bring my black widow now
2014-10-04T19:47:38  <kenel> Dreday00 pm me an email
2014-10-04T19:49:02  <kenel> oh yeah
2014-10-04T19:49:08  <kenel> selling invites gets you perm banned
2014-10-04T19:49:09  <kenel> no thanks ;\
2014-10-04T19:49:29  <duuuuude> thats if they find out, and the torrent site is usually the one selling the invites
2014-10-04T19:51:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Most of the stuff I would torrent I pay for - both because it's rare and I need to help support it, and because they are pretty incredible at making pirated copied hard to find.
2014-10-04T19:53:29  <duuuuude> i pirate everything, but i also pay for the things i like and bought netflix, so it all works out

2014-10-05T01:53:41  <kenel> then they save all their money they get from doing weddings and buy expensive ass cars
2014-10-05T01:53:47  <kenel> while living tax free
2014-10-05T01:53:52  <kenel> and here's the secret
2014-10-05T01:54:02  <kenel> most of them have girlfriends no one knows about :P
2014-10-05T01:54:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Were that true, they probably wouldn't be touching on little boys :P
2014-10-05T01:55:03  <kenel> trust me, they do
2014-10-05T01:55:19  <kenel> and only a small percentage of that population are boy touchers
2014-10-05T01:55:30  <kenel> just like any other population that's as big as the catholic clergy
2014-10-05T01:55:48  <kenel> you're bound to have a few bad apples...the difference is that unless it's the clergy, it just never makes the news
2014-10-05T01:56:16  <cosmo> seems to be my default mode anyway wolf might as well get professional with it >:D YEAH
2014-10-05T01:56:33  <kenel> i bet if you took the top 500 CEOs in america, you're bound to find several of them with KP fetishes or like 16 year old boys
2014-10-05T01:57:08  <cosmo> oh yeah
2014-10-05T01:57:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: That's fair to say - also, 16 year olds is not pedo
2014-10-05T01:57:19  <cosmo> don't sultans have concubines of both sexes?
2014-10-05T01:57:29  <kenel> possibly, i don't know
2014-10-05T01:57:32  <kenel> but look at teachers
2014-10-05T01:57:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Now I know what I'm gonna be.
2014-10-05T01:57:48  <kenel> every year you read about teachers that have sex with their 13 year old students
2014-10-05T01:57:50  <cosmo> an oil lord of the middle east? hell yeah
2014-10-05T01:57:51  <kenel> teachers are a huge population
2014-10-05T01:58:05  <kenel> but teachers don't have religious affiliations with them so you only blame the teacher or the school
2014-10-05T01:58:11  <kenel> not the whole school system
2014-10-05T01:58:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Yep. Don't need the oil, I want the option of male/female/both concubines :D
2014-10-05T01:59:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Yep - but I gotta say
2014-10-05T01:59:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> the incidence of pedo does seem /slightly/ higher in the clergy than in the gen. pop.
2014-10-05T01:59:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> maybe not by a ton
2014-10-05T01:59:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but still
2014-10-05T02:00:10  <kenel> if i saw numbers, i could probably argue against that point
2014-10-05T02:00:31  <kenel> but i'm pretty sure you won't find a chart that shows convicted pedos in the catholic church vs. the rest of the population
2014-10-05T02:01:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: True - I'll retract it.
2014-10-05T02:17:49  <cosmo> is mintpal up yet?
2014-10-05T02:18:03  <bittrex-ryan> lol
2014-10-05T02:18:33  <bittrex-ryan> kenel knows exactly which pastors in his area touch little boys

2014-10-05T14:33:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And the best part?
2014-10-05T14:34:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Well, they decided on one hash function, but the community wanted it to be like X11 - many hash functions, let the GPU run nice and cool.
2014-10-05T14:34:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Which, of course, means that there will be potential for stupid massive gains
2014-10-05T14:35:33  <moriarty> lol
2014-10-05T14:35:35  <moriarty> good luck pal
2014-10-05T14:35:37  <moriarty> but then again
2014-10-05T14:35:41  <moriarty> you're not mining or trading so...
2014-10-05T14:35:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Hell, if it comes out at 3AM, I should have 2x to 4x the speed before my sister gets up at six.
2014-10-05T14:35:47  <moriarty> you're not as stupid as the rest of them
2014-10-05T14:36:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> VTC doesn't know it
2014-10-05T14:37:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but what they're really doing is raising the value of my shit xD
2014-10-05T14:38:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> By generating hype over the revamp and new PoW, they're getting interest and raising the price; in turn, large farmers I know and I should benefit proportional to the increase

2014-10-05T15:03:45  <Dreday00> why ddos the good guys?
2014-10-05T15:03:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Dreday00: I really like TradeMyBit. It's quite profitable, although usually less so than NiceHash. But I use it anyway, because its stats are unmatched - and I obviously need those.
2014-10-05T15:04:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Dreday00: They don't hate you.
2014-10-05T15:04:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It's very simple.
2014-10-05T15:04:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> DDoSing a large pool greatly lowers the diff - makes it easier for them to mine.
2014-10-05T15:05:20  <Dreday00> like an unexpected restart
2014-10-05T15:05:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> better than that, for them
2014-10-05T15:06:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's as if everyone mining on that pool without a failover suddenly stopped mining
2014-10-05T15:06:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> because.. well... they did :P
2014-10-05T15:06:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Which, as long as you can keep it up, will lower the diff by a LOT if it's a big pool.
2014-10-05T15:07:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> If you have a lot of hash to mine with after you've dropped the diff, it becomes quite profitable
2014-10-05T15:07:27  <Dreday00> but how do they attackers profit  if the pool is down?
2014-10-05T15:07:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Dreday00: Uh... other pools? Solo mining?
2014-10-05T15:07:43  <Dreday00> oh
2014-10-05T15:07:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Likely solo.
2014-10-05T15:07:55  <Dreday00>  i see isee
2014-10-05T15:08:32  <Dreday00> well atleast pple are interested in the coin enough to ddos it
2014-10-05T15:09:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Bright side

2014-10-05T19:42:36  <kenel> my dogs keep pissing on my carpet downstairs
2014-10-05T19:42:38  <kenel> i'm about to kill them
2014-10-05T19:42:40  <kenel> literally
2014-10-05T19:42:43  <kenel> sell them to chinese restaurant
2014-10-05T19:43:14  <Dreday00> i never had a dog but I remmeber seeing a piss pad that looks like grass
2014-10-05T19:43:27  <kenel> yeah, it's not that
2014-10-05T19:43:29  <kenel> they get let out all the time
2014-10-05T19:43:34  <kenel> it's a behavioral thing and i have bulldogs
2014-10-05T19:43:39  <Dreday00> oh
2014-10-05T19:43:39  <kenel> and bulldogs are the most stubborn
2014-10-05T19:43:48  <kenel> (kind of like me i guess)
2014-10-05T19:44:23  <kenel> omg
2014-10-05T19:44:29  <Jackstraw2> posative reinforcement man
2014-10-05T19:44:29  <kenel> fucking MobGod 's defense is going to beat me
2014-10-05T19:44:38  <kenel> Jackstraw2 i tried, i give up
2014-10-05T19:44:47  <kenel> it's been 3 years now and they still don't give a fuck
2014-10-05T19:44:52  <Jackstraw2> ignore them when they do it give them a treat when thye do it outside they figure it out quick
2014-10-05T19:45:10  <kenel> no, all that does for my dogs is make them sit by the back door waiting for a treat, lol
2014-10-05T19:45:23  <kenel> any training method i've known for dogs (which i've had my entire life) does not work with these dogs
2014-10-05T19:45:27  <kenel> the only thing that works is yelling louder
2014-10-05T19:45:33  <Jackstraw2> lol well yeah
2014-10-05T19:45:35  <kenel> they are literally that stubborn
2014-10-05T19:45:54  <Jackstraw2> i used to train dogs if your persistent they will catch on
2014-10-05T19:46:05  <Jackstraw2> i had a minpin that was stubborn too
2014-10-05T19:46:09  <kenel> my one dog was kicked out of training class because she wasn't motivated by treats, toys, or anything that wasn't her flavor of the day
2014-10-05T19:46:37  <Jackstraw2> independent sombitch eh?
2014-10-05T19:46:39  <kenel> also my wife works with the chicago english bulldog rescue
2014-10-05T19:46:46  <kenel> so she likes the dogs more than me and my kids
2014-10-05T19:47:05  <Jackstraw2> yeah i know how that is
2014-10-05T19:47:15  <Jackstraw2> my wife is like that with cats
2014-10-05T19:47:44  <Jackstraw2> could try clicker training
2014-10-05T19:48:02  <Jackstraw2> only thing that got my dobe-lab to cooperate
2014-10-05T19:48:21  <kenel> yeah, dobes/labs are smart dogs
2014-10-05T19:48:25  <kenel> and labs love pleasing owners
2014-10-05T19:48:31  <kenel> bulldogs....they don't give a fuck
2014-10-05T19:48:41  <kenel> trust me, the trainer couldn't figure it out either
2014-10-05T19:48:44  <Jackstraw2> yeah bulldogs are something
2014-10-05T19:48:50  <kenel> i've always had dobes and border collies growing up
2014-10-05T19:49:01  <Jackstraw2> my borther has one that was the drake school mascot for a bit
2014-10-05T19:49:05  <Jackstraw2> fuckin diva

2014-10-05T20:19:13  <kenel> oh yeah
2014-10-05T20:19:21  <kenel> i started donnell after his performance last week over kelce
2014-10-05T20:19:26  <kenel> donnell = 0 pts
2014-10-05T20:19:30  <kenel> kelce will probably get 20
2014-10-05T20:20:21  <Trenal> and he fumbles
2014-10-05T20:20:29  <Trenal> can't beat the bucs
2014-10-05T20:20:32  <Trenal> gonna lose to the jags

2014-10-05T20:26:00  <Trenal> I would be embarassed if that was my background
2014-10-05T20:26:27  * Wolf|WinLaptop laughs.
2014-10-05T20:26:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm into one hell of a lot more than that.
2014-10-05T20:26:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> that I just don't care if anyone knows it
2014-10-05T20:27:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Anyway, hashrates
2014-10-05T20:31:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> They're still going up
2014-10-05T20:31:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but my strategy used so far is beginning to take more time than it's worth
2014-10-05T20:32:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I can search for low hanging fruit and fix it
2014-10-05T20:32:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> which takes little time
2014-10-05T20:32:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but often results in small increases
2014-10-05T20:32:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> or, I can do what I did earlier, that is, spend an asston of time completely rewriting a hash
2014-10-05T20:33:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> with an implementation meant ffor GPU
2014-10-05T20:33:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But that takes time, and it's discouraging, because you can't really see a faster working miner very often :(
2014-10-05T20:36:32  <Jackstraw2> be wort it if your paid right
2014-10-05T20:37:02  <duuuuude> your hash inscrease for x11 should be worth something
2014-10-05T20:37:14  <Jackstraw2> yep
2014-10-05T20:37:31  <Jackstraw2> fuck donations people are stingy
2014-10-05T20:37:43  <Jackstraw2> especially with prices how they are
2014-10-05T20:42:37  <Trenal> so are we still hashing on pollerrangers ?
2014-10-05T20:44:44  <Trenal> looks like I lose this week
2014-10-05T20:44:50  <Trenal> stupid Steelers/Ben
2014-10-05T20:45:57  <Jackstraw2> need about 15 to 20 point average to stay top 3
2014-10-05T20:46:05  <Jackstraw2> 25 average and your golden
2014-10-05T20:46:18  <Jackstraw2> i dont think im gonna hit it this week

2014-10-05T20:54:23  <Jackstraw2> i know but this week he could do well
2014-10-05T20:55:15  <Jackstraw2> i think it will be close but you will win
2014-10-05T20:55:18  <techbytes1_> too many receivers on denver sharing the load
2014-10-05T20:56:01  <Jackstraw2> yes but arizona is week in the middle where welker shines
2014-10-05T20:56:26  <techbytes1_> then he better put up monster points..
2014-10-05T20:56:34  <Jackstraw2> i know it
2014-10-05T20:57:03  <Trenal> 8 QB points

2014-10-05T20:58:46  <Jackstraw2> i am due for a shitter week
2014-10-05T20:58:55  <Jackstraw2> ill finish top three though
2014-10-05T20:59:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Jackstraw2: I was talking about my speed increase
2014-10-05T21:00:07  <Trenal> Olsen grabbing a late TD would help
2014-10-05T21:00:09  <Jackstraw2> yeah i figured that out after thinking about it
2014-10-05T21:00:18  <emdes> pff pff.. damn 10A burning
2014-10-05T21:00:23  <Jackstraw2> sorry trading football bunch of shit going on
2014-10-05T21:00:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And naming a price doesn't work - cause then living expenses eat it
2014-10-05T21:00:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Jackstraw2: So, I didn't release it, nor sell it
2014-10-05T21:01:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I leased it.
2014-10-05T21:01:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> To a farmer with ~1100 GPUs
2014-10-05T21:01:28  <Jackstraw2> well set yourself a percentage or something, if the gain is good people will be ok with it
2014-10-05T21:01:39  <Jackstraw2> yeah i read that on dark
2014-10-05T21:01:41  <Jackstraw2> nice job
2014-10-05T21:01:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Jackstraw2: Not a good idea
2014-10-05T21:01:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Remember girino?
2014-10-05T21:02:03  <Jackstraw2> yeah
2014-10-05T21:02:07  <Jackstraw2> true
2014-10-05T21:02:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> They reverse engineered his miner and ripped out the kernel to remove the fee, I mean, Jesus.
2014-10-05T21:02:24  <techbytes1_> damn kenel, panthers just scored to take the lead..
2014-10-05T21:02:29  <Jackstraw2> yep dicks
2014-10-05T21:02:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Maybe miners tend to feel entitled to everything, but going that far is on a different level
2014-10-05T21:03:18  <Jackstraw2> thats the crypto mentality at work
2014-10-05T21:03:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And they personally fucked me over - barely any donations from my earlier projects
2014-10-05T21:03:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> which were released immediately
2014-10-05T21:03:34  <Jackstraw2> seen that many times
2014-10-05T21:04:00  <Jackstraw2> have to think about a way to get some ongoing profits from it if you do it
2014-10-05T21:04:19  <Jackstraw2> maybe a private pool that donates a percentage to you
2014-10-05T21:04:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Yep. So, not only am I going to improve X11 more, probably ending around 3x the public hashrate
2014-10-05T21:04:49  <Jackstraw2> thats badass
2014-10-05T21:04:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'll continue on after, and be like, "Shit, I just do this for the haters, I don't need the money." :P
2014-10-05T21:05:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Also, I have a way to get ongoing profits
2014-10-05T21:05:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> the farmer I'm leasing the X algo code to
2014-10-05T21:05:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm getting 50% of the profit generated from the difference between my code vs public
2014-10-05T21:05:46  <Jackstraw2> well just keep that going until something bettr is proposed
2014-10-05T21:06:21  <Jackstraw2> its good to see people that put the work in get treated well
2014-10-05T21:06:25  <Jackstraw2> as they should
2014-10-05T21:06:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I came up with that deal - it's nice because it's mathematically impossible for one of us to benefit from the code while the other doesn't
2014-10-05T21:06:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> unlike a flat %
2014-10-05T21:07:16  <Jackstraw2> right now with btc prices im hoping alot of people turn of their rigs and drop the diff for a bt
2014-10-05T21:07:41  <Jackstraw2> i got free power so i could score on that shit

2014-10-06T04:28:43  <kenel> what the hell is a front loader doing on the track
2014-10-06T04:28:51  <kenel> doesn't the front loader know they're racing?
2014-10-06T04:33:20  <RunningmanZ> They are the tractors they use to lift the cars off the track during a race
2014-10-06T04:34:41  <RunningmanZ> They should have had the safety car straight out tho when the first car crashed
2014-10-06T04:34:41  <RunningmanZ> The guy was extremely unlucky to slide under the tractor
2014-10-06T04:34:41  <RunningmanZ> Was pretty bad weatehr conditions at that stage too

2014-10-06T07:32:41  <RaNa> I know but just looking forward to it
2014-10-06T07:32:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Miners are a mainstay, but only currently. While they'll need a lot of time to be phased out, I think they will be
2014-10-06T07:33:06  <moriarty> miners are going to scream in pain
2014-10-06T07:33:45  <RaNa> why do you thank that they are making money
2014-10-06T07:33:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Anyways, I only have one AMD rig that is mostly for development, and she'll be profitable for me on X11 long after everyone with the same cards mining the same thing at half the power cost have sold their shit
2014-10-06T07:33:57  <moriarty> lol
2014-10-06T07:34:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> RaNa: hm?
2014-10-06T07:35:15  <RaNa> They're going to make money now and then later just leave which is not a problem to them at all lol they sill win kind of
2014-10-06T07:35:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> RaNa: Not all miners will - but it matters little to me
2014-10-06T07:36:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> As long as those miners are paying me.
2014-10-06T07:39:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So, really, I win - because not only am I in crypto

2014-10-06T10:29:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cause a ton of people ask me that

2014-10-06T11:13:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> My SGMiner 5 - same code from GitHub with my modified X11 - puts out 22.30MH/s while using 835W
2014-10-06T11:13:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The difference in total hashrate, over the 270X, 280X, 290X, and 7950, is 34.34%
2014-10-06T11:13:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The increase in power usage, however, is 12.84%
2014-10-06T11:15:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Assuming no other costs, and the only revenue being from hash, profit goes up substantially.

2014-10-06T14:20:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Trenal: Whether or not you know cops that are good people, and they exist, the job attracts those who just want power, and abuses, at least in the US, are rampant.
2014-10-06T14:23:13  <Trenal> Of course, but I doubt they'd really shoot an air conditioner
2014-10-06T14:23:16  <Trenal> unless it was black

2014-10-06T14:29:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I was suggesting it should start with, "If cops were any dumber and more abusive...:"
2014-10-06T14:30:26  <dreday-mobile_> how low did btc go?
2014-10-06T14:34:28  <Trenal> 290s I think
2014-10-06T14:36:31  <dreday-mobile_> you think it was a big dog sell off?
2014-10-06T14:37:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> dreday-mobile_: That much is clear
2014-10-06T14:37:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It's also clear it was meant to dump the price to hell
2014-10-06T14:37:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Someone wanted this to happen
2014-10-06T14:38:07  <dreday-mobile_> mega whales dumping?

2014-10-06T14:42:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Massive sell orders every hour on the hour isn't someone trying to exit their position
2014-10-06T14:42:57  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's someone trying to cause panic

2014-10-06T15:48:00  <cosmo> i went to a landlord class a few days ago and was the youngest person there by a longshot
2014-10-06T15:48:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Just do what you've got to to get to whatever your goal is.
2014-10-06T15:48:25  <Trenal> Yeah, if you want to make money dont get into real estate
2014-10-06T15:48:35  <Trenal> unless you can pay off the property quickly
2014-10-06T15:48:43  <Trenal> I own a couple duplexes
2014-10-06T15:48:45  <Trenal> pain in my ass
2014-10-06T15:48:58  <Trenal> have 2 of the 4 emptry right now, new flooring/windows in one

2014-10-06T15:53:20  <Trenal> Probably 65-70k
2014-10-06T15:53:29  <Trenal> they are lower income in a small Missouri town
2014-10-06T15:53:41  <moriarty> lol

2014-10-06T15:53:47  <Trenal> so not a big financial hit on the mortgage, just the upkeep
2014-10-06T15:54:03  <kenel-work2> moriarty why do you only talk like once every 3 months?
2014-10-06T15:54:03  <moriarty> only an idiot would go into real estate now
2014-10-06T15:54:06  <Trenal> and shit renters
2014-10-06T15:54:14  <Trenal> I've had them for 10 years
2014-10-06T15:54:18  <moriarty> kenel-work2, busy with work whassup
2014-10-06T15:54:35  <kenel-work2> no, just wondering; everyone essentially thinks your a bot because of that :P
2014-10-06T15:54:39  <moriarty> Trenal, you should have sold them off a long time ago
2014-10-06T15:54:53  <moriarty> kenel-work2, then again bitcoin community isn't the smartest kid on the block :P

2014-10-06T15:57:36  <Trenal> The rental properties are a family thing, I'm not really looking at making a ton of money
2014-10-06T15:57:52  <Trenal> my grandfather built the whole block, so my family tries to keep ownership of them
2014-10-06T15:58:02  <Trenal> so no, I shouldn't have sold them a long time ago
2014-10-06T15:58:09  <Trenal> thanks for playing
2014-10-06T15:59:09  <moriarty> cosmo, RE?

2014-10-06T16:00:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> [09:56:16]	cosmo	i know i'm not gonna be happy with whatever amount of money i have
2014-10-06T16:00:11  <cosmo> i was too when i was getting it, between tears
2014-10-06T16:00:15  <moriarty> cosmo, i see
2014-10-06T16:00:17  <moriarty> cosmo, how old?
2014-10-06T16:00:23  <cosmo> 22
2014-10-06T16:00:24  <moriarty> cosmo, does your liberal studies include economics?
2014-10-06T16:00:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That's a terrible way to look at it
2014-10-06T16:00:42  <cosmo> i had one macroeconomics class.
2014-10-06T16:00:53  <cosmo> it's the truth wolf
2014-10-06T16:01:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> You have to dream big - not about having money fall in your lap, but about making it big. Then wake up and go and get it.
2014-10-06T16:01:06  <moriarty> cosmo, right, anyway, real estate is a bubble that popped back in 2008
2014-10-06T16:01:13  <moriarty> cosmo, last thing you want to be getting involved in is RE
2014-10-06T16:01:27  <moriarty> cosmo, even Buffett got burnt when he predicted too early of a RE bounce
2014-10-06T16:01:47  <kenel-work2> blah blah blah real estate is getting propped up right now by the democratic party in order to boost confidence for the 2016 election
2014-10-06T16:02:18  <kenel-work2> bbl
2014-10-06T16:02:25  <cosmo> so what, from what i hear it was best time to buy during that pop, 6 years later it's too late?
2014-10-06T16:02:31  <moriarty> cosmo, lol no
2014-10-06T16:02:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol, you want to buy LONG before it
2014-10-06T16:03:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and sell RIGHT before it
2014-10-06T16:03:06  <moriarty> lol if you want to play the long game, sure
2014-10-06T16:03:11  <moriarty> but i'm an impatient person
2014-10-06T16:03:16  <moriarty> and don't want my money stuck in some shit for decades
2014-10-06T16:03:40  <moriarty> and the best part is, when 2008 happened, i bet a lot of those RE people were like fuck, there goes my decades wait for nothing
2014-10-06T16:04:05  <moriarty> anyway there are some property owners on ##econometrics - i'm sure they can tell you all about it
2014-10-06T16:04:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: I think you might reconsider when you have more money than you could hope to spend in multiple lifetimes.
2014-10-06T16:04:18  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, lol why would i reconsider?
2014-10-06T16:04:29  <cosmo> cuz you'll die eventually
2014-10-06T16:04:44  <cosmo> with the rest of us :)
2014-10-06T16:04:49  <moriarty> hehe
2014-10-06T16:04:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: Because the money may as well be doing SOMETHING
2014-10-06T16:04:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and if you're not gonna use it
2014-10-06T16:04:57  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, i see
2014-10-06T16:04:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> why the fuck not
2014-10-06T16:05:07  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, well there are better things to put monies into, even if i got shittonnes of it
2014-10-06T16:05:18  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, it's not as if the stock market can't take billions of dollars of capital
2014-10-06T16:05:19  <moriarty> :)
2014-10-06T16:05:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: I didn't mean on RE, I meant on long term
2014-10-06T16:05:31  <moriarty> well, same for long term
2014-10-06T16:05:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ah
2014-10-06T16:05:46  <moriarty> real estate tracks inflation
2014-10-06T16:05:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then you gotta babysit it though lol

2014-10-06T16:07:32  <moriarty> why did you think 2008 happened?
2014-10-06T16:07:42  <moriarty> gosh some people are really clueless about the biggest thing to have happened in decades
2014-10-06T16:07:59  <moriarty> and people wonder why i think the bitcoin community is stupid
2014-10-06T16:08:42  <Trenal> Yes, your random internet troll opinions to the bitcoin community of millions
2014-10-06T16:08:48  <Trenal> mean a lot
2014-10-06T16:08:55  <cosmo> cuz whatever business on wall st. made a fuckton of mortgage loans to deadbeats, then sold those loans to other companies that didn't know the people were deadbeats
2014-10-06T16:09:48  <cosmo> of course people default on their mortgages en masse, the myriad of companies that bought the loans were fucked over, blah blah wall st. was a magical black hole of finances that sapped the economy and crippled it once again.
2014-10-06T16:09:48  <moriarty> Trenal, pro-tip, read more, talk less
2014-10-06T16:10:49  <Trenal> What should I read o wise sage
2014-10-06T16:10:52  <cosmo> student loans are the next legal loophole getting raped now
2014-10-06T16:11:08  <cosmo> my whole generation is willfully entering indentured servitude, wow
2014-10-06T16:11:24  <cosmo> am i right or wrong mort
2014-10-06T16:11:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol, I refuse to go to college until I can pay for it
2014-10-06T16:12:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Borrowing a fuckton and then using it for college, hoping you get a good job right out of college because you have a shiny new piece of paper so that you can pay it back is gambling
2014-10-06T16:13:40  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, there is truth in that
2014-10-06T16:13:56  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, Peter Thiel would be happy if you didn't go to college and instead started a company under his tutelage :)
2014-10-06T16:14:17  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, i don't fully agree with Thiel, but then again i can see the appeal in not subscribing to the conventional route of the degree paper mills
2014-10-06T16:14:42  <moriarty> Trenal, anything and everything you can get your hands on :)
2014-10-06T16:14:58  <moriarty> Trenal, economics is not like the sciences, there is no one bible, the more you read, the better off you'd be
2014-10-06T16:15:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> moriarty: it's not to say college isn't valuable at all - I'm simply not convinced that it's such a fuckin' awesome thing that I should take out a loan to get it ASAP
2014-10-06T16:15:22  <cosmo> just go beat an orphan right now to get in the right mindset Trenal

2014-10-06T16:18:31  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, agreed :) i think if you're making money already, and decent ones at that, you might want to pass up college, maybe get an MBA at some point once you've got decent cashflow
2014-10-06T16:18:44  <moriarty> Wolf|WinLaptop, the nice thing about an MBA is that it's only one or two years depending on which country you're in
2014-10-06T16:19:03  <moriarty> and your wages jump up if you're open to the possibility of doing something tangential to what you're doing
2014-10-06T16:19:17  <moriarty> although chances are that an MBA requires you to have a degree for the most part :)
2014-10-06T16:19:24  <moriarty> i don't know if working experience substitutes that
2014-10-06T16:19:29  <moriarty> much less if you're self-employed
2014-10-06T16:19:51  <moriarty> so maybe community college > some affiliated four-year school > MBA
2014-10-06T16:19:58  <moriarty> that would be the cheapest and surest way
2014-10-06T16:20:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Good to know.
2014-10-06T16:20:31  <moriarty> an MBA in my opinion represents the best value for money due to the salary increase you get before and after
2014-10-06T16:21:17  <moriarty> i had a friend who was poor as a churchmouse before, and was working all sorts of trading sales jobs before, random places and such
2014-10-06T16:21:43  <moriarty> and he got his parents to mortgage their place so he can attain an MBA at some prestigious school
2014-10-06T16:21:50  <moriarty> his bachelor's was in some shit school btw
2014-10-06T16:22:26  <moriarty> once he got an MBA, he rose up to VP in the same amount of time it took someone else with just a degree with top marks and top working ethics to rise up to VP as well
2014-10-06T16:22:32  <moriarty> which was mighty impressive IMO
2014-10-06T16:22:49  <moriarty> considering he wasn't a bright kid, and the other person who was top of the world in terms of his scores and such
2014-10-06T16:23:13  <moriarty> and both of them are now VPs in some Fortune500 bank
2014-10-06T16:23:41  <moriarty> heh sure makes me want to get an MBA
2014-10-06T16:31:37  <cosmo> how can you not be content with several million, what else do ya need
2014-10-06T16:33:04  <Trenal> The more money you make, the more you want
2014-10-06T16:33:09  <Trenal> its the human condition
2014-10-06T16:34:39  <cosmo> i wasted too much of my life trying to believe in humanity, i tell ya wh'at
2014-10-06T16:35:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It is true, but usually only to a point - once you have more than you can spend, you want it just to have it, not because there's something you wish to do with it
2014-10-06T16:35:07  <Trenal> easy Hank
2014-10-06T16:35:08  <cosmo> if i'd learn to give in to bloodlust years earlier coulda really fought my way somewhere valuable
2014-10-06T16:35:30  <Trenal> you're still young, I didnt get my shit together until I was 25
2014-10-06T16:35:36  <Trenal> and I'm doing fine in my mid 30s
2014-10-06T16:35:48  <cosmo> yeah, i'm not worried about my life
2014-10-06T16:36:12  <cosmo> just disappointed with it
2014-10-06T16:36:26  <cosmo> the only problem is that people sell themselves short
2014-10-06T16:36:27  <moriarty> cosmo, believing in humanity is a good thing
2014-10-06T16:36:33  <Trenal> My 18-25 years were wasted on MMOs and selling weed
2014-10-06T16:37:16  <Trenal> but I learned a lot in regards to where I needed my future to go
2014-10-06T16:37:48  <cosmo> moriarty do you work with any charities or anything like that
2014-10-06T16:37:57  <moriarty> cosmo, i used to
2014-10-06T16:38:09  <Eli0t> creating your own weed selling MMO
2014-10-06T16:38:20  <cosmo> lol, why'd ya stop? not trying to be a dick, genuinely curious.
2014-10-06T16:38:35  <moriarty> cosmo, because i've learnt enough :)
2014-10-06T16:38:44  <cosmo> yeah
2014-10-06T16:39:05  <cosmo> donate a nickel, the charity organization takes 4 cents for 'operational costs'
2014-10-06T16:39:34  <cosmo> only thing keeping me sane is a belief in karma and reincarnation
2014-10-06T16:39:34  <moriarty> cosmo, well, for me, i was curious about the soft side of things, dealing with people, learning the human condition, and helping out those less fortunate
2014-10-06T16:39:44  <moriarty> cosmo, but it was never going to be a life-long vocation for me
2014-10-06T16:39:50  <moriarty> cosmo, just a curiosity
2014-10-06T16:40:01  <moriarty> cosmo, so you could say it was partially self-serving
2014-10-06T16:40:16  <cosmo> that's life, look out for #1
2014-10-06T16:40:21  <moriarty> but well i know that at some point in my life, i would like to give away some of my fortune to them :)
2014-10-06T16:40:25  <moriarty> just not at this point
2014-10-06T16:40:38  <moriarty> my philosophy is make as much money as possible
2014-10-06T16:40:51  <moriarty> and then once my time is up, make sure i have a will in place that gives away my fortune to the needy
2014-10-06T16:40:54  <moriarty> etc
2014-10-06T16:41:12  <cosmo> nice
2014-10-06T16:41:20  <moriarty> i'm probably not as nice as others who genuinely are nice souls
2014-10-06T16:41:32  <moriarty> they give away a portion of their salary every month to charity because they feel they have more than enough to survive
2014-10-06T16:41:34  <cosmo> yeah, those people are usually broke
2014-10-06T16:41:37  <moriarty> and these are academic lecturers etc
2014-10-06T16:41:43  <moriarty> not the best earners in the world
2014-10-06T16:41:46  <moriarty> i admire their souls
2014-10-06T16:42:01  <moriarty> but i know i'm probably a bit too narcissistic to do that
2014-10-06T16:42:03  <moriarty> oh well
2014-10-06T16:42:21  <cosmo> that's what i'm saying, karma and reincarnation
2014-10-06T16:42:36  <moriarty> lol i think for me it stems from me working hard in my childhood
2014-10-06T16:42:43  <moriarty> so now i'm having my actual childhood :)
2014-10-06T16:42:51  <moriarty> partying hard :P
2014-10-06T16:43:01  <cosmo> meh
2014-10-06T16:43:08  <cosmo> ego is part of evolutionary design
2014-10-06T16:43:19  <moriarty> it's alright to want to take care of yourself first
2014-10-06T16:43:22  <moriarty> charity begins at home :)
2014-10-06T16:43:58  <cosmo> i'm just grappling with whether or not i should be thankful for my folks, ya know
2014-10-06T16:44:10  <moriarty> what's your folks got to do with anything though?
2014-10-06T16:44:23  <cosmo> it'd be hard to succeed in the world without them
2014-10-06T16:44:42  <cosmo> pretty much be stuck in min. wage for years, would take a lot longer to work up to the top.
2014-10-06T16:44:56  <cosmo> EU is a lot nicer in their education, over here you gotta pay an arm and a leg.
2014-10-06T16:45:31  <moriarty> there's no free lunch though
2014-10-06T16:45:41  <moriarty> EU's "free" education is a result of high taxes
2014-10-06T16:45:53  <moriarty> in the US, you are expected to save up for your kid's education
2014-10-06T16:45:56  <cosmo> well if i'm broke i don't think that's going to be my concern :p
2014-10-06T16:45:57  <moriarty> that's why the taxes are lower
2014-10-06T16:46:13  <cosmo> i see
2014-10-06T16:46:16  <moriarty> well taxes go up pretty quickly the moment you earn in an EU country
2014-10-06T16:46:30  <cosmo> true but you'll still be earning more overall right
2014-10-06T16:46:41  <cosmo> for the same amount of effort
2014-10-06T16:46:41  <moriarty> earning more overall?
2014-10-06T16:46:53  <moriarty> well, i think it's generally the same
2014-10-06T16:47:02  <moriarty> it's just different culture that's all
2014-10-06T16:47:05  <moriarty> and different setups
2014-10-06T16:47:20  <cosmo> hm
2014-10-06T16:47:23  <moriarty> the US working culture may be a bit more narcissistic
2014-10-06T16:47:32  <cosmo> it is
2014-10-06T16:47:35  <moriarty> but that's because labour laws are less protective of employees in the US
2014-10-06T16:47:40  <moriarty> so people get fired more easily
2014-10-06T16:47:52  <moriarty> but it also means you get to find jobs easily too
2014-10-06T16:48:02  <moriarty> and getting fired is not such a big taboo
2014-10-06T16:48:03  <cosmo> yeah, i agree
2014-10-06T16:48:12  <moriarty> in the EU, you get fired less, so more deadwood in companies
2014-10-06T16:48:20  <moriarty> and when you do get fired, it's a bit of a taboo issue
2014-10-06T16:49:12  <moriarty> i think the nice thing about the US or not so nice thing, depending on which level of society
2014-10-06T16:49:20  <moriarty> is that you keep what you earn past a certain point :)
2014-10-06T16:49:28  <moriarty> it's more "egalitarian" in the EU
2014-10-06T16:49:34  <moriarty> which means you are less incentivised to earn more
2014-10-06T16:49:53  <moriarty> so in terms of effort, i think you earn more in the US past a certain point
2014-10-06T16:50:07  <moriarty> but if you're one of the lower earners, then maybe EU would seem like a paradise
2014-10-06T16:50:22  <cosmo> yeah, pretty much
2014-10-06T16:50:42  <cosmo> a friend of mine wanted to try school out and got a loan, his family is a buncha drug addicts though and he kinda bungled it, now he's 10k in debt
2014-10-06T16:51:04  <cosmo> i shoulda kept in touch with all my old high school friends to see how many of them are chained to the gov't
2014-10-06T16:51:19  <moriarty> i see
2014-10-06T16:51:21  <cosmo> if their parents cosigned those loans, they can legally reposess their house if they don't pay
2014-10-06T16:51:23  <moriarty> so does he have to pay up the debt?
2014-10-06T16:51:28  <moriarty> or do you only start paying when you work?
2014-10-06T16:51:36  <moriarty> i see
2014-10-06T16:51:42  <cosmo> i don't know, i haven't talked to him in a while
2014-10-06T16:51:55  <cosmo> even then that's something people don't talk about because they don't wanna deal with it. so of course the problem persists.
2014-10-06T16:54:36  <cosmo> then they have kids and tell em 'yaaah go to school!' makes me wanna puke on their shoes
2014-10-06T16:55:13  <cosmo> people being people being people being people

2014-10-07T01:29:37  <DGCBread> Hello there, what is up with DGC these days?
2014-10-07T01:34:06  <cosmo> heya
2014-10-07T01:34:30  <cosmo> not too much, bittrex listed us
2014-10-07T01:37:27  <DGCBread> I think I might be out of DGC all together pretty soon. It just seems like so much has shifted so quickly. I am not optimistic anymore. I went from 500K, then 400K, 200K and I am thinking of dumping down to 50K
2014-10-07T01:37:52  <kenel> what makes you not optimistic?
2014-10-07T01:38:13  <RunningmanZ> yeah we are going DGC V3 soon why dump
2014-10-07T01:38:28  <kenel> also, if you're thinking of dumping on an exchange....contact a foundation member first; I'm sure we'll buy it from you anyway

2014-10-07T02:22:37  <samson_> You should delete your responses, relaunch your fundraiser in a new SELF MODDED THREAD to which I will respond with a post stating I am confident now that baritus is gone.

2014-10-07T02:44:44  <RunningmanZ> finally some sanity prevails
2014-10-07T02:48:38  <Dreday00> I dont understand
2014-10-07T02:49:09  <Dreday00> Baritus created DGC right?
2014-10-07T02:49:46  <Dreday00> Baritus has resigned from DGC  right?
2014-10-07T02:52:20  <cosmo> yep and yep
2014-10-07T02:53:35  <Dreday00> ok so Dgc doesn't have like an overlord?
2014-10-07T02:54:22  <cosmo> no cryptocurrency does, that's kind of the point of them
2014-10-07T02:54:31  <cosmo> except for maybe instamined proof-of-stake coins
2014-10-07T02:55:22  <cosmo> baritus was a good dev
2014-10-07T02:56:05  <Dreday00> He was Im jk
2014-10-07T02:58:04  <Dreday00> I used to call him Lord Baritus

2014-10-07T03:31:55  <Dreday00> I might dedicate a fury to each
2014-10-07T03:41:51  <duuuuude> could alway merge mine arg into DGC

2014-10-07T13:10:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Some dipshit was talking about how he's done optimizations to X11, and believes my predictions are BS, saying he "highly doubts" that X11 could be improved even another 40%

2014-10-07T14:21:45  <kenel-work2> you should instead aspire to be a sultan

2014-10-07T14:22:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel-work2: Can't you get concubines of both sexes? Sign me up!
2014-10-07T14:22:51  <kenel-work2> of course
2014-10-07T14:22:59  <kenel-work2> but not if you're in iran
2014-10-07T14:23:04  <kenel-work2> there's no gays in iran remember?

2014-10-07T14:24:02  <dreday-mobile> take your riches to thailand
2014-10-07T14:24:55  <kenel-work2> i have figured out, thanks to Wolf|WinLaptop , the equation for whether or not sir mix a lot will show up to your party
2014-10-07T14:25:07  <kenel-work2> A = B^32 - W(S8/(C - D))
2014-10-07T14:25:07  <kenel-work2> right equation is for figuring out buns, A = anaconda....if buns < 0, anaconda don't want none
2014-10-07T14:25:07  <dreday-mobile> anywayz what would be the down side to the profit pools
2014-10-07T14:25:17  <kenel-work2> makes sense when you draw it up
2014-10-07T14:25:25  <dreday-mobile> lol
2014-10-07T14:26:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> dreday-mobile: Might be a good idea
2014-10-07T14:26:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but amphetamine is illegal there
2014-10-07T14:26:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> might have to settle for France.
2014-10-07T14:26:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> for my vacation
2014-10-07T14:26:31  <dreday-mobile> france would work
2014-10-07T14:27:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> anyway, the downside to profit pools is usually the instasell - they will sell indiscriminately, giving not a fuck about the price

2014-10-07T20:24:11  <kenel-work2> emdes, why is everyone trying to make their coins -i.e. WA Coin- asic resistant when asics are one of the keys to actually securing the coin's blockchain from attacks?
2014-10-07T20:27:29  <emdes> why is the sky blue kenel-work2 ? : )
2014-10-07T20:27:58  <kenel-work2> you want the real answer to that?
2014-10-07T20:28:01  <kenel-work2> because there is one
2014-10-07T20:28:02  <kenel-work2> :P
2014-10-07T20:28:12  <emdes> I know :p
2014-10-07T20:28:30  <kenel-work2> it's the same reason water appears blue
2014-10-07T20:31:54  <kenel-work2> of course the week after i drop pierre thomas he has a ridiculous fucking week
2014-10-07T20:31:58  <kenel-work2> of fucking. course.
2014-10-07T20:35:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel-work2: it's simple
2014-10-07T20:35:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> asics don't secure a blockchain
2014-10-07T20:35:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> unless the coin can be asic mined WAY faster than GPU or CPU mined
2014-10-07T20:36:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ASICs also are extremely destructive to a coin
2014-10-07T20:36:21  <kenel-work2> i wouldn't say they're destructive
2014-10-07T20:36:27  <kenel-work2> but they can be used in a destructive manner
2014-10-07T20:36:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> centralization and 0.00001% of people profiting - while GPU mining is unfair cause some people can afford more GPUs
2014-10-07T20:36:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ASICs blow that up a hundredfold
2014-10-07T20:36:58  <kenel-work2> ok, but let's say i can buy 500$ worth of video cards and get 3mh/s
2014-10-07T20:37:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> suddenly, the only people who can get an asic are those making it - the super rich - and they only sell them because they can mine on them
2014-10-07T20:37:07  <kenel-work2> i can buy 75$ worth of furys and get the same while using a ton less power
2014-10-07T20:37:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then dump them on the consumer
2014-10-07T20:37:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel-work2: again, you are comparing on a currency that CAN be asic mined
2014-10-07T20:37:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> like that
2014-10-07T20:37:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It is easy to make a coin where ASICs will be a dog
2014-10-07T20:37:47  <kenel-work2> right, but that's assuming that all coins mined will be dumped
2014-10-07T20:38:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel-work2: Companies ain't interested in your monopoly money - KnC dumps even BTC
2014-10-07T20:38:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> instantly.
2014-10-07T20:38:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> They are interested in profit. Fiat USD, bigger numbers on that paper.
2014-10-07T20:39:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Some small-timers are like that - but with ASICs, you're handing control of the coin to those guys
2014-10-07T20:39:17  <samson_> so how long until X11 goes ASIC ?
2014-10-07T20:40:11  <kenel-work2> x11 goes asic would be a good title for a nerd rock band :P
2014-10-07T20:40:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: Quite a while - FPGA isn't even in play, because if it were and a bunch of people had it
2014-10-07T20:40:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> GPU would be over
2014-10-07T20:40:31  <samson_> ok so 6-12 months ?
2014-10-07T20:41:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> samson_: It totally depends on how profitable it is - but really, I think in 12mo, we should have companies announcing development and probably taking preorders
2014-10-07T20:41:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> for FPGA and/or ASIC
2014-10-07T20:41:37  <samson_> ok so there's still a good bit of mileage left in X11

2014-10-07T23:58:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: Speaking of a lot of hash
2014-10-07T23:59:09  <Rickus> heh, that's pretty awesome
2014-10-07T23:59:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I can probably borrow more X11 hash at close to power cost.
2014-10-07T23:59:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 4 - 5GH/s
2014-10-08T00:00:31  <Rickus> well, that's the thing, those 7970 rigs can do ~740 kh/s per card yet drawing 900W at the wall.
2014-10-08T00:01:09  <Rickus> not as efficient when elec isn't free
2014-10-08T00:01:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: Tried X11?
2014-10-08T00:01:19  <Rickus> I did when Darkcoin launched
2014-10-08T00:01:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> The SG5 kernel of X11 runs cooler on GPU
2014-10-08T00:01:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Way cooler than scrypt
2014-10-08T00:01:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and uses less power
2014-10-08T00:01:52  <Rickus> but back then it was not optimized at all.. I think I was getting 1.6-1.8 MH/s
2014-10-08T00:02:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It's still not - believe me.
2014-10-08T00:02:27  <Rickus> hah, you've made that clear in your work :)
2014-10-08T00:02:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> SG5 kernel gets 4.2MH/s on a 280X, and that's badman74's "optimized" one
2014-10-08T00:03:04  <RunningmanZ> Rickus:Yeah hope Lewis and Nico take each other out of a couple of races lol
2014-10-08T00:03:14  <Rickus> No x11 coins worth mining right now (when factoring elec costs) afaik though.
2014-10-08T00:03:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: Multipools help.
2014-10-08T00:03:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Plus, NiceHash is even better
2014-10-08T00:03:55  <Rickus> I'm mining DGC to help (heh) support the network
2014-10-08T00:04:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> whenever there's a shitcoin launch
2014-10-08T00:04:10  <Rickus> Nicehash?
2014-10-08T00:04:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> NiceHash prices go through the roof
2014-10-08T00:04:21  <Rickus> I'm a bit out of the loop :)
2014-10-08T00:04:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> yeah - renting rigs without having to have perfect uptime and find buyers and shit
2014-10-08T00:04:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> from your end - looks just like a multipool with better payouts
2014-10-08T00:04:55  <Rickus> RZ: Oh, they will. There's no way they're going to be good boys on the track when the title is getting closer every race.
2014-10-08T00:05:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So whenever there's a shitcoin launch, people bid it high
2014-10-08T00:05:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Not to mention X13 and X15 also have plenty of coins that can get pumped or have shitcoin launches
2014-10-08T00:05:56  <Rickus> ah, yeah, isn't that the rated one where you put your hardware up for rent?
2014-10-08T00:06:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: Nope - you rent your hardware just by connecting and mining
2014-10-08T00:06:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> you can stop anytime - paid per valid share
2014-10-08T00:06:35  <Rickus> hmm, will look into it
2014-10-08T00:07:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Yep. If not them, multipools are usually good.
2014-10-08T00:07:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Auto-switch auto-exchange
2014-10-08T00:08:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Used to be you could do better manual if you had a lot of time
2014-10-08T00:08:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but they've got it down to an art form, now
2014-10-08T00:10:01  <Rickus> figured as much, time works out the kinks
2014-10-08T00:10:09  *** Dreday00 <Dreday00!~ssdre@24.104.211.174> has quit IRC (Read error: Connection timed out)
2014-10-08T00:11:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I use TradeMyBit
2014-10-08T00:11:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 0.5% pool fee, 2% fee on auto exchange
2014-10-08T00:11:27  <Rickus> Might be worth it to run 1/2 my hash rate on multi till dgc 3.0 comes out
2014-10-08T00:13:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And while my optimizations have shown that the X11 kernel wasn't up to par, I'm not done - needs to be clearer :P
2014-10-08T00:14:42  <Rickus> Hah, what would you recommend I run on trademybit? would be running 6x7970s.
2014-10-08T00:15:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> You can have it auto-switch to the most profitable algo, but X11 is almost always the most profitable
2014-10-08T00:16:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I like just using the X11 multiport.
2014-10-08T00:16:55  <Rickus> ok, but which version of sgminer should I use for x11?
2014-10-08T00:17:11  <Rickus> I'm guessing you're keeping your version to yourself :)
2014-10-08T00:17:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> SGMiner 5, of course. SPH-sgminer is dead.
2014-10-08T00:17:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And I'm actually using the miner straight from git - no mods
2014-10-08T00:17:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I just changed the kernels
2014-10-08T00:18:05  <Rickus> ah, all your mods are in the kernels?
2014-10-08T00:18:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'll eventually have to make some small edits to the miner to modify how kernels are launched
2014-10-08T00:18:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but for now, yep
2014-10-08T00:18:27  <Cart> All my GPU fans are dieing :( Forced to use x11. Too lazy to send them in for warantee replacement :P

2014-10-08T00:20:03  <Rickus> haha, yup
2014-10-08T00:20:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Either my 270X is really doing 5.35MH/s
2014-10-08T00:20:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> or it dun crashed lol

2014-10-08T00:35:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That ought to improve hash per watt nicely
2014-10-08T00:35:28  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Putting my 270X at 1050mV now
2014-10-08T00:43:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Well, shit.
2014-10-08T00:43:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> It can do 3.65 or so at 1150
2014-10-08T00:43:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I think it was at 1150
2014-10-08T00:43:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and is doing... wait... did it crash?
2014-10-08T00:44:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I wanna get it stable at 1000mV
2014-10-08T00:47:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Nice - looks like 3.17 - 3.18 from dropping it to 1000mV
2014-10-08T00:47:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That ain't too bad.
2014-10-08T00:49:56  <Cart> hehe, you guys inspired me to RMA one of my GPUs...will see how it goes. Have 5 more to RMA

2014-10-08T00:57:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 3.35 - 3.40MH/s on my 270X now - using 1075/1500 on 1050mV

2014-10-08T05:47:49  <RunningmanZ> my wife went to the all girls one just down the road but i never knew her at that stage
2014-10-08T05:47:51  <RunningmanZ> lol
2014-10-08T05:47:53  <Jackstraw2> mine was a little different
2014-10-08T05:47:55  <kenel> i don't even remember doing the kissy face
2014-10-08T05:48:00  <Jackstraw2> like 85% girls
2014-10-08T05:48:01  <kenel> i saw this and laughed my ass of
2014-10-08T05:48:04  <Jackstraw2> 15% dudes
2014-10-08T05:48:13  <Jackstraw2> shooting fish in a barrel
2014-10-08T05:48:15  <Jackstraw2> lol
2014-10-08T05:48:29  <kenel> i do remember, during the groom/bride photos, because i knew the photographer...i was behind them in almost every shot giving the middle finger
2014-10-08T05:48:35  <RunningmanZ> nice ratios there jack
2014-10-08T05:48:37  <RunningmanZ> :D
2014-10-08T05:48:42  <kenel> i feel like an asshole now, but it was so funny to myself during the wedding
2014-10-08T05:48:47  <Jackstraw2> yeah it was something
2014-10-08T05:48:56  <kenel> photag kept saying 'don't worry, i can photoshop him out'
2014-10-08T05:50:21  <RunningmanZ> lol didn't the bride go apeshit at you for ruining all the photos?
2014-10-08T05:50:22  <RunningmanZ> lol
2014-10-08T05:50:32  <kenel> nah
2014-10-08T05:50:35  <kenel> she didn't know i don't think

2014-10-08T05:50:59  <kenel> they know me
2014-10-08T05:51:13  <kenel> it's not easy being a friend to me in real life...and likely the same on irc as well, lol
2014-10-08T05:51:23  <RunningmanZ> lol
2014-10-08T05:51:34  <RunningmanZ> you mean ur an ass in RL too? :P

2014-10-08T05:53:03  <RunningmanZ> translate that :D
2014-10-08T05:53:22  <kenel> i don't speak german
2014-10-08T05:53:26  <kenel> but i'm assuming...
2014-10-08T05:53:42  <kenel> he's asking where to trade digitalcoin
2014-10-08T05:53:53  <kenel> and the second guy is saying something about it being before a dogecoin war
2014-10-08T05:53:55  <RunningmanZ> yeah we are 'old school' ;)
2014-10-08T05:54:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Yo
2014-10-08T05:54:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I used to compile SGMiner for Win64 every week off git for the Windows guys

2014-10-08T05:55:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Bottom of the OP
2014-10-08T05:55:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And check the goddamned GPG sigs.
2014-10-08T05:56:21  <kenel> clue me in, that's above my pay grade
2014-10-08T05:56:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: My God, man
2014-10-08T05:56:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> you should know GPG if you're running a coin
2014-10-08T05:57:18  <kenel> i'm not running a coin, i'm just the president of the foundation
2014-10-08T05:57:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: I'm serious, that's fucking bad. It makes it very easy for people to impersonate you and tell others to do shit
2014-10-08T05:58:02  <kenel> it's pretty hard to figure out my personality
2014-10-08T05:58:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> GPG encryption and signatures means that if you say something stupid
2014-10-08T05:58:13  <kenel> the people that matter know who i am
2014-10-08T05:58:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they can request you sign it
2014-10-08T05:58:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: Okay, how 'bout this
2014-10-08T05:58:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> devs upload a binary
2014-10-08T05:58:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it gets switched out for malware
2014-10-08T05:58:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> How do they prove they didn't do it?
2014-10-08T05:59:01  <kenel> ahmed, samson, and xawksow would figure it out in about 2 seconds
2014-10-08T05:59:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> No, if the server was compromised, you may not know for days
2014-10-08T05:59:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That's why important things are GPG signed
2014-10-08T05:59:46  <kenel> I wouldn't know until they told me actually
2014-10-08T06:00:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> because an attacker simply can't replicate it without your key
2014-10-08T06:00:27  <kenel> i'm not the coin developer(s); just the foundation president
2014-10-08T06:00:35  <kenel> i understand what you're saying
2014-10-08T06:00:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> This way, I am staking my reputation, not only on the forums, but on bitcoin-orc, as it's the same key, that my binaries are legit
2014-10-08T06:01:26  <kenel> so you're suggesting when we do 3.0, we should include the GPG in the btctalk thread?
2014-10-08T06:02:21  <kenel> i have a lot of talents, but at the same time i realize i'm not the best programmer, etc. etc......and the guys in the foundation specialize in stuff like this
2014-10-08T06:02:45  <kenel> what i am good at is making things profitable, getting things done, motivating people; everything business owners/managers do
2014-10-08T06:03:31  <kenel> so instead of saying how stupid i am, just inform me of why it makes sense; i take it in, understand it's valuable, and we incorporate it :)
2014-10-08T06:04:44  <kenel> i follow you though
2014-10-08T06:06:36  <Wolf`> Yeah, I suggest that
2014-10-08T06:07:15  <Wolf`> I mean, it's not one of those things you think you need often, because usually if you have it, people won't even try to break into your shit and swap out binaries
2014-10-08T06:07:26  <Wolf`> And I'm not saying you're stupid lol
2014-10-08T06:07:40  <Wolf`> just that it shouldn't be overlooked
2014-10-08T06:07:47  <Wolf`> It's happened to coins before
2014-10-08T06:07:51  <Wolf`> and now they're dead
2014-10-08T06:07:53  <kenel> i was only raised by an electronic engineer; i'm not one myself :\
2014-10-08T06:08:31  <kenel> honestly if my dad was 20 years younger, he'd probably of invented an asic that was 10x faster than what we have now
2014-10-08T06:08:39  <RunningmanZ> kenel:You need to Try OculusRealPorn "Red Passion" on the DK2. Daaaymn! :D
2014-10-08T06:08:49  <kenel> i hate my dad, but i have no doubt he'd of done that
2014-10-08T06:08:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> kenel: I'm sure he had the knowledge...
2014-10-08T06:08:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but the fab?
2014-10-08T06:09:11  <kenel> well, he invented something...
2014-10-08T06:09:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I mean, those would probably be 20nm or 14nm chips.
2014-10-08T06:09:19  <kenel> i don't give a shit
2014-10-08T06:09:22  <kenel> www.thedenier.com
2014-10-08T06:09:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Making just ONE would be HELLA expensive
2014-10-08T06:09:40  <kenel> took goose lights for ponds and made them into something no one else can do
2014-10-08T06:09:45  <vinje> You guys are doing so many interesting things to our chat alerts today >_<
2014-10-08T06:09:59  <kenel> shuttup vinje and just get your blumpkin

2014-10-08T06:11:00  <kenel> yeah, my dad has first hand knowledge of dealing with chinese
2014-10-08T06:11:09  <kenel> i think he lost like 5k on an order for his boards from them
2014-10-08T06:11:35  <kenel> which at the time was a lot considering he was putting me through catholic high school on an engineer's salary :P
2014-10-08T06:11:44  <kenel> i think he was working at fox32 chicago at the time
2014-10-08T06:14:18  <RunningmanZ> vinje:You finished that My Little Pony marathon yet? :P
2014-10-08T06:14:53  <vinje> lol

2014-10-08T06:43:36  <RunningmanZ> lol do they read it?
2014-10-08T06:44:19  <RunningmanZ> Sometimes me 10 yr old tries to read IRC and I'm like 'eh get out of it,nothing to see here...."
2014-10-08T06:44:21  <RunningmanZ> :D
2014-10-08T06:44:45  <vinje> no, usually they're too focused on me making their facebook or LOL work.
2014-10-08T06:44:52  <vinje> :)

2014-10-08T09:28:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> hey, CoHe
2014-10-08T09:28:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm undervolting a ton
2014-10-08T09:28:39  <CoHe> Morning Wolf
2014-10-08T09:28:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Getting pissed at this 280X, though
2014-10-08T09:28:58  <CoHe> how come?
2014-10-08T09:29:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it seems to have BIOS signature enforcement like my 290X - the 290X I have signed BIOSes ranging from absurdly low voltages to fuck high ones signed by an AMD engineer
2014-10-08T09:29:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> For the 280X, I don't
2014-10-08T09:30:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Which means to get the wattage for all undervolted, I'll have to use my other one >.<
2014-10-08T09:30:17  <CoHe> Hard to sort out?
2014-10-08T09:31:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> No, Stilt isn't around anymore
2014-10-08T09:31:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so it's swap out the 280X, and I like my new one
2014-10-08T09:31:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> or use Windows
2014-10-08T09:31:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Or show up at an AMD engineer's residence with a pistol and demand he sign my BIOS :|
2014-10-08T09:31:54  <CoHe> lolz
2014-10-08T09:32:54  <CoHe> the latter is probably not a good idea u`d miss all the exciting new stuff  unless you can mine from prison
2014-10-08T09:33:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol, I just need to not get caught
2014-10-08T09:33:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Plenty of pissed miners out there
2014-10-08T09:33:32  <Wolf|WinLaptop> suspect pool is pretty big :P
2014-10-08T09:34:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But really, AMD is on some bullshit
2014-10-08T09:34:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Locking Hawaii is not cool - but on top of that, they make it so the voltage may ONLY be raised, even on Windows
2014-10-08T09:35:10  <CoHe> If you are not able to sort it out I suspect no one is
2014-10-08T09:35:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Even were I a Win user, I would have to go through - very likely multiple - bios flashing attempt
2014-10-08T09:35:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> just to get it going
2014-10-08T09:35:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> CoHe: No, I have the 290X undervolted
2014-10-08T09:35:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And AMD can kiss my ass.
2014-10-08T09:36:31  <CoHe> So maybe Win is an option
2014-10-08T09:38:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Ehhh... would fucking suck. A lot.
2014-10-08T09:38:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> SSH is *the* thing I use for remote access - using cygwin would be a pain
2014-10-08T09:38:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but doable
2014-10-08T09:38:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> There may be only one way to undervolt the 280X on *nix
2014-10-08T09:39:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> that is, with a signed BIOS
2014-10-08T09:39:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but there's more than one way to skin a cat
2014-10-08T09:39:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> if you can't get a custom one signed
2014-10-08T09:39:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Find a stock one signed - cards with lower ASIC quality get more voltage
2014-10-08T09:39:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and vice versa
2014-10-08T09:39:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so if you go through the internet collecting all you can find for this model and ones just like it
2014-10-08T09:40:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then load them up in VBE7 and check volts
2014-10-08T09:40:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ONE of them has to have high ASIC quality, and therefore a lower voltage
2014-10-08T09:40:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Won't be as low as you'd want it, likely - but more than enough to make a large difference in power usage
2014-10-08T09:42:41  <CoHe> Which would do the job
2014-10-08T09:42:54  <CoHe> I am very curious to see if that works out
2014-10-08T09:42:58  <CoHe> Bet it will
2014-10-08T09:43:23  <CoHe> Wolf I need to go for a quick errand..brb
2014-10-08T09:45:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> k
2014-10-08T09:45:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm gonna put in my Dual-X for now

2014-10-08T16:59:49  <Rickus> Hey Wolf, I'm trying x11 now with badman's binaries. Getting ~4.2 MH/s on a 7970 @ 1020/1500 @ 1.07 V - is that ok?
2014-10-08T17:00:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Perfect - he said 4.2MH/s exactly on 280X
2014-10-08T17:00:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> which is 7970 with lower power use, pretty much
2014-10-08T17:01:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Actually, that's pretty impressive
2014-10-08T17:01:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> for those volts
2014-10-08T17:01:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and clocks
2014-10-08T17:01:20  <Rickus> three cards are running that
2014-10-08T17:01:25  <Rickus> cool
2014-10-08T17:02:06  <Rickus> haven't hooked up killawatt yet, but guessing from the heat/fan/temps I'm around 500-600 W
2014-10-08T17:02:27  <Rickus> err X11
2014-10-08T17:02:39  <Rickus> I said that. lol. was up all night
2014-10-08T17:02:43  <Rickus> zzzzzzzzz
2014-10-08T17:03:26  <Rickus> tweaking it and going outside occasionally, looking for a break in the clouds to photograph the blood moon.
2014-10-08T17:03:36  <Rickus> unfortunately, it started to rain :(
2014-10-08T17:04:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I was up all night, too
2014-10-08T17:08:44  <Rickus> Asic quality ranging from 60s to 70s
2014-10-08T17:16:03  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Ugh - usually the compiler is good at unrolling loops
2014-10-08T17:16:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So I made it heavy on loops
2014-10-08T17:16:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's not terrible at it, like it is most other things
2014-10-08T17:16:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but now it's being kinda meh
2014-10-08T17:18:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> There we go, now she's performing
2014-10-08T17:18:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Just needed a few loops to be forcibly unrolled
2014-10-08T17:18:59  <Rickus> I understand the theory of this, but beyond that...
2014-10-08T17:20:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: Basically, unrolling loops is good on a GPU because they fucking SUCK at making decisions
2014-10-08T17:21:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> What makes GPUs able to have so many processors is because those processors are stupid.
2014-10-08T17:21:24  <Rickus> right, that I understand
2014-10-08T17:21:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> They're made to do computations over and over - CPUs are more decision making
2014-10-08T17:21:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so the if number > x jump shit
2014-10-08T17:21:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> they don't like that
2014-10-08T17:21:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> BUT
2014-10-08T17:21:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> if you unroll too much
2014-10-08T17:22:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then the processor will have to go out to memory to fetch more code - you want the code to fit in the cache
2014-10-08T17:22:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> since that fetch is fuck slow
2014-10-08T17:22:28  <Rickus> hah
2014-10-08T17:22:32  <Wolf|WinLaptop> you want to unroll as much as you can
2014-10-08T17:22:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but not past that point
2014-10-08T17:22:56  <Rickus> how do you monitor this though?
2014-10-08T17:23:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Trial and error, more or less
2014-10-08T17:23:32  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Not really a good way to tell if the code fits in the cache - unless you know the cache size and look at th ebinary
2014-10-08T17:23:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *the binary
2014-10-08T17:23:44  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but it's simpler for me to just try it
2014-10-08T17:23:53  <Rickus> understood
2014-10-08T17:24:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> the old CubeHash implementation used variables.... 32 of them.
2014-10-08T17:24:35  <Rickus> Would be nice to see all the registers/etc in realtime to see where its choking
2014-10-08T17:25:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> If you're gonna force the compiler to put your data in memory - you may as well take advantage of the ability to dynamically index it >.<
2014-10-08T17:25:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> You can
2014-10-08T17:25:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> with CUDA
2014-10-08T17:25:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> dunno about AMD
2014-10-08T17:26:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Since I used one array of 32 integers, not only is my code not hundreds of lines and readable by humans
2014-10-08T17:26:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but I can also roll up most operations in CubeHash into loops
2014-10-08T17:26:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then I unroll select ones at will
2014-10-08T17:26:32  <Rickus> too cool :)
2014-10-08T17:27:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Yeah - before, the only unrolling you could do was of the rounds - you could unroll all 16 rounds, terrible idea, or use a loop to run them
2014-10-08T17:27:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But that's not granular enough
2014-10-08T17:27:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> because the rounds are rather big, and you must do two at a time - an even and odd one
2014-10-08T17:28:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So you'll either end up with wasted cache space or, what actually happens in this case, those slow-ass fetches
2014-10-08T17:30:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 280X went from around 5.7MH/s to 5.8MH/s+, but I think I can tweak it some more before I move on
2014-10-08T17:45:32  <Rickus> Holy hell I hate stupid people
2014-10-08T17:46:00  <Rickus> any chance I can beta test for you? :D :D
2014-10-08T17:52:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol, stupid people are everywhere...
2014-10-08T17:52:59  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and I have several testers - I told my farmer no one had it but me and my testers, so adding one now would be kind of dishonest.
2014-10-08T17:53:18  <Rickus> hopefully I'm not one of them... :)
2014-10-08T17:53:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol - all my testers know about it :D
2014-10-08T17:54:48  <Rickus> np. I set one rig up on trademybit with auto exchange enabled - nice site! Thanks for the tip :)
2014-10-08T17:55:01  <Wolf|WinLaptop> no problem
2014-10-08T17:55:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> anyway, going afk for a bit
2014-10-08T17:55:13  <Rickus> doubt it'll be profitable though :P

2014-10-08T18:10:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but I can make money here mining.
2014-10-08T18:13:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: Trying some higher volts for vanity hashrates :D
2014-10-08T18:15:24  <Rickus> you can at that rate? via trademybit? On gpus?
2014-10-08T18:16:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I usually go by NiceHash
2014-10-08T18:16:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> TMB, sometimes, but I think I can break even
2014-10-08T18:16:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> requires hardcore volt dropping
2014-10-08T18:16:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but doable
2014-10-08T18:17:50  <Rickus> what makes Nicehash more profitable though?
2014-10-08T18:19:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: Idiots.
2014-10-08T18:19:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> They rent hash at stupid prices whenever a shitcoin clone comes out
2014-10-08T18:19:33  <Rickus> ha
2014-10-08T18:19:34  <Rickus> LOL
2014-10-08T18:21:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Seriously
2014-10-08T18:21:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Profitable over straight mining
2014-10-08T18:22:05  <Rickus> So you're selling your hash power?
2014-10-08T18:22:42  <techbytes-lenovo> they do that on betarigs too... that's why i always rent 6 hours ahead of shitcoin launch.
2014-10-08T18:24:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: That's what nicehash is
2014-10-08T18:24:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but with NH
2014-10-08T18:24:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> you don't have to care about the details
2014-10-08T18:24:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> point to their port and mine when you want, stop when you want
2014-10-08T18:24:24  <Rickus> Sorry, it's been a while since I've looked into this. Noob questions :)
2014-10-08T18:24:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> you're paid for every valid share
2014-10-08T18:24:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and if you leave, the work will be redistributed
2014-10-08T18:24:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Hit 5.8MH/s on 280X :D
2014-10-08T18:24:55  <Rickus> ok, understood. But who sets the rental rates on NH though?
2014-10-08T18:25:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: Idiots.
2014-10-08T18:25:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> They buy hashrate
2014-10-08T18:25:14  <Rickus> HAH
2014-10-08T18:25:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> for shitcoin launches
2014-10-08T18:25:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm serious
2014-10-08T18:25:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's basically a bidding war
2014-10-08T18:26:16  <Rickus> So on NH, you have to know which algo to mine though - there's no auto-switching
2014-10-08T18:26:33  <Rickus> nm, reading :)
2014-10-08T18:26:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: You can auto-switch to most profitable
2014-10-08T18:27:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And even set ratios
2014-10-08T18:27:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> if your x13 hashrate is a certain amount below your x11 hashrate
2014-10-08T18:27:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> then you can tell their autoswitcher how much
2014-10-08T18:27:40  <Rickus> damn cool

2014-10-08T18:36:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> basically, if bid < threshold - NH kills your connection so you failover

2014-10-08T20:18:34  <Rickus> hmm what's happening at btc38? Going lower gradually over the last week while Cryptsy has been steady.
2014-10-08T20:33:17  <cosmo> seems normal to me
2014-10-08T20:33:31  <cosmo> kinda funny we say 3.0 and the price jumps, what
2014-10-08T20:34:54  <Rickus> no, i mean the difference between the trends of crypsty and btc38

2014-10-08T22:58:44  <Rickus> Wolf, with your X11 mods, is your power consumption growing linearly with the hash rate? Or is it less/more efficient?
2014-10-08T22:58:57  <Rickus> I guess it depends on the card too.
2014-10-08T22:59:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Linearly? No way

2014-10-08T22:59:31  <techbytes> just fired up my 280x on my x11 pool...  2.28mh running at I 13
2014-10-08T22:59:36  <Wolf|WinLaptop> An average over most AMD chips shows it's FAR more efficient - here are some stats
2014-10-08T23:00:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Idle at 123W. Stock SG mines at 16.60MH/s and uses 740W, while mine gets 22.30MH/s while using 835W to do it. Difference in hashrate is 34.34%, which difference in power use is 12.84%
2014-10-08T23:00:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> If you undervolt, that shit only gets better
2014-10-08T23:01:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That's an average across a 270X, 280X, 290X, and 7950

2014-10-08T23:01:52  <Rickus> Cause before I added some of badman's config tweaks, I was running at 890/1000 @ ~3.3 MH @ 0.95V which seems far away from my 1020/1500 @ 4.3 MH @ 1.07V. Still have to killawatt it though.
2014-10-08T23:02:07  <Rickus> really. wow
2014-10-08T23:02:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Rickus: You WANT your GPU to run hot - as hot as possible. Because it will ALWAYS be more efficient than wasting compute power by not using it
2014-10-08T23:02:33  <Wolf|WinLaptop> (assuming stock volts)
2014-10-08T23:03:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> that's generally how you can tell if a kernel not heavy on memory usage is good or not
2014-10-08T23:03:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> if it's ice cold
2014-10-08T23:03:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it sucks
2014-10-08T23:03:57  <Rickus> It's a bell curve though - at one point, the chip is going to consume more power *just* cause of the current temp of the gpu
2014-10-08T23:04:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Very true - which is why you undervolt
2014-10-08T23:04:19  <Rickus> right
2014-10-08T23:04:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but you want to make that fucker eat powr
2014-10-08T23:04:21  <Wolf|WinLaptop> *power
2014-10-08T23:04:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> at stock volts
2014-10-08T23:04:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> because that means you're using the resources available
2014-10-08T23:05:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> We didn't decide we were gonna drop intensity a few notches to cool our GPUs :P
2014-10-08T23:05:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> when mining scrypt, I mean
2014-10-08T23:05:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> oh, and by the way
2014-10-08T23:05:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> undervolting with my kernel, I managed these
2014-10-08T23:06:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 20.9MH/s using 687W. 17.73% drop in power use with only 6.28% reduction in hash
2014-10-08T23:06:11  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and if you wanna go more hardcore
2014-10-08T23:06:22  <Rickus> right, but from my experience, stock volts on a 7970 OEM is 1.175 - which pushes up the consumption massively without being able to OC any further than at 1.07V - this is what I see over 6 cards on scrypt.
2014-10-08T23:06:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 642W @ 20.2MH/s - 9.42% hash reduction for 23.11% power use reduction.
2014-10-08T23:06:47  <Rickus> hah, too cool
2014-10-08T23:08:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So, I think at stock volts
2014-10-08T23:08:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> power usage will continue to rise about 1/3rd of the percentage of hashrate increase
2014-10-08T23:08:41  <Rickus> It seems that the efficiency "profile" on X11 has a lot more headroom to play with than on scrypt.
2014-10-08T23:08:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> What do you mean?

2014-10-09T01:44:31  <samson_> bought 100's of thousands of them there - no problems

2014-10-09T01:49:28  <samson_> it works for me anyway

2014-10-09T02:35:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> She pulls 642W at the wall
2014-10-09T02:35:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Whoa.
2014-10-09T02:35:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Yeah, overvolting and high clocks are for setting records, kids, not 24/7 mining - that's for damn sure.
2014-10-09T02:36:23  <Trenal> common sense
2014-10-09T02:37:02  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Trenal: Yes, it is common sense than temps + power draw will be higher
2014-10-09T02:37:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but I didn't know it would be this much higher
2014-10-09T02:37:51  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it seems to rise exponentially while hashrate increases linearly after a point
2014-10-09T02:41:05  <Trenal> makes sense
2014-10-09T02:42:55  <Wolf`> where that point is would make it possible to easily find optimal hash/watt
2014-10-09T02:44:45  <cosmo> what's going on wolf?

2014-10-09T02:57:14  <Wolf`> cosmo: got insane hashrates
2014-10-09T02:57:21  <Wolf`> but also at insane power usage
2014-10-09T02:57:30  <Wolf`> was a suicide benchmark run
2014-10-09T02:57:47  *** Dreday00_ <Dreday00_!~ssdre@24.104.211.174> has joined #digitalcoin
2014-10-09T02:58:12  <Wolf`> 3.83MH/s on 270X
2014-10-09T02:58:18  <Wolf`> 280X did 5.87MH/s
2014-10-09T02:58:30  <Wolf`> 7950 5.25, and 290X 8.09
2014-10-09T02:58:47  <Wolf`> but the power usage for that suicide benchmark run...
2014-10-09T02:58:57  <Wolf`> total hash on it was 23MH/s or so
2014-10-09T02:59:06  <Wolf`> if I drop clocks and volts to 20.2MH/s
2014-10-09T02:59:19  <Wolf`> I use 642W instead of 990W lol

2014-10-09T03:07:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol why?
2014-10-09T03:08:22  <cosmo> ...
2014-10-09T03:08:28  <cosmo> oh, no reason
2014-10-09T03:08:33  <kenel> so i didn't watch son's of anarchy last week
2014-10-09T03:08:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Oh, for telling you about undervolting?
2014-10-09T03:08:42  <kenel> and i miss the episode with marilyn manson and courtney love
2014-10-09T03:09:11  <emdes> chiznitz !!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQ_IQS3VKjA something for you :)
2014-10-09T03:09:18  <cosmo> for making improved mining software..
2014-10-09T03:09:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: but I don't release it anymore lol
2014-10-09T03:10:07  <cosmo> it's the principal of the matter, that someones out there, doing something
2014-10-09T03:10:42  <emdes> 6:08 to 6:14 in that vid...
2014-10-09T03:10:53  <emdes> 100 DGC if you try that trick cosmo
2014-10-09T03:11:01  <emdes> and upload the vid :p
2014-10-09T03:12:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Ah, okay

2014-10-09T03:14:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 280X gets 4.2MH/s according to badman74 :D
2014-10-09T03:14:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I wanna get 5.8+ without OV
2014-10-09T03:14:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So tired cause of this virus, though
2014-10-09T03:22:01  <cosmo> more drugs
2014-10-09T03:25:24  <emdes> hahaha
2014-10-09T03:27:05  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: I would
2014-10-09T03:27:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but the thing is
2014-10-09T03:27:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> if it takes a large amount of amphetamine to make me just feel okay
2014-10-09T03:27:29  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'm better off going to sleep rather than taking it and running out later
2014-10-09T03:28:59  <cosmo> that's true
2014-10-09T03:29:17  <cosmo> take a week off of them just to see if you can live sober.
2014-10-09T03:29:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I can't
2014-10-09T03:29:27  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I mean, I'll live
2014-10-09T03:29:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but it's pure hell
2014-10-09T03:30:13  <cosmo> it sure is
2014-10-09T03:33:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So yeah - if I'm not high I'm probably in bed
2014-10-09T03:33:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> usually asleep
2014-10-09T03:36:17  <cosmo> listen to some george carlin

2014-10-09T03:38:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Would be cool
2014-10-09T03:39:52  <cosmo> make any more deals with farms?

2014-10-09T03:42:12  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I plan to keep it that way
2014-10-09T03:42:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> for now
2014-10-09T03:42:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and for X11
2014-10-09T03:43:24  <cosmo> gl with it
2014-10-09T03:43:40  <cosmo> how much did your mom charge you for rent?
2014-10-09T03:47:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> ~500/mo
2014-10-09T03:48:39  <cosmo> geez
2014-10-09T03:50:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> that's rent/bills/everything else
2014-10-09T03:50:51  <cosmo> ah she rents too then
2014-10-09T03:50:58  <Wolf|WinLaptop> yep
2014-10-09T03:51:04  <cosmo> i guess she's employed?
2014-10-09T03:51:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Disabled.
2014-10-09T03:51:17  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That's the reason I *had* to pay
2014-10-09T03:51:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> as soon as I got out of HS
2014-10-09T03:51:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> like half the money she was getting just disappeared
2014-10-09T03:51:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> so for us to afford to stay where we are
2014-10-09T03:51:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I had to generate income
2014-10-09T03:52:36  <cosmo> i'm surprised my parents let me sit on my ass like this
2014-10-09T03:53:08  <Wolf|WinLaptop> My mom would have - for a little while
2014-10-09T03:53:34  <cosmo> yeah but homelessness kinda sucks when you're old
2014-10-09T03:54:24  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I don't plan on being homeless lol
2014-10-09T03:54:25  <cosmo> you should take that 10 grand and put a down payment on a shitty little place, and live off minimum wage till ya pay it off
2014-10-09T03:54:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'd want time to sit on my ass until I could make money
2014-10-09T03:54:39  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but I never got that time
2014-10-09T03:54:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> that 15 large - an asston went to paying her back for floating me
2014-10-09T03:55:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> now I'm clear and may begin stacking loads of paper :D
2014-10-09T03:55:20  <cosmo> as you will
2014-10-09T03:55:39  <cosmo> probably should get a job though, unless you really know you'll be reeling in another big deal
2014-10-09T03:55:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I have a steady stream of income
2014-10-09T03:56:09  <Wolf|WinLaptop> my deal is a percentage of the increase over public
2014-10-09T03:56:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I don't sell something that valuable for a lump sum :P
2014-10-09T03:56:57  <cosmo> yeah, you'll be fine
2014-10-09T03:57:17  <cosmo> so long as you keep developing. that's how baritus made his fortune.
2014-10-09T03:57:20  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I hope so; gotta keep performing miracles :P
2014-10-09T03:57:27  <cosmo> and you're working in an area of high demand.
2014-10-09T03:57:50  <cosmo> make a name for yourself, start an LLC
2014-10-09T03:57:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Yeah, but it's honestly an area that can go poof
2014-10-09T03:58:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I can make loads of shit faster, though
2014-10-09T03:58:16  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So I need to work on more income streams
2014-10-09T03:58:25  <cosmo> wouldn't hurt
2014-10-09T03:58:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I need several farmers, across wildly different algos, paying me - at least.
2014-10-09T03:58:53  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So even if the public catches up with one or one is leaked, it won't affect the others.
2014-10-09T04:01:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That way I have reliability; can't be wondering if I'll have rent on time
2014-10-09T04:01:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> or be one fuckup away from broke
2014-10-09T04:02:55  <cosmo> how much are ya paying per month now?
2014-10-09T04:03:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Around $500 for all living expenses and shit
2014-10-09T04:04:38  <cosmo> apply for aid, you could probably get fafsa pretty easy
2014-10-09T04:05:10  <cosmo> sadly you're doing a lot better than most people our age
2014-10-09T04:05:34  <cosmo> society has already collapsed, it's peoples expectations that are keeping things the way they are
2014-10-09T04:06:12  <cosmo> and man debugging people is the most impossible thing
2014-10-09T04:06:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Aid? I'm not crippled, I can make money.
2014-10-09T04:06:25  <cosmo> some of them really are impossible
2014-10-09T04:06:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'd prefer to do it out of the US, though
2014-10-09T04:06:37  <Wolf|WinLaptop> as they're on some bullshit
2014-10-09T04:06:48  <cosmo> do what outside of the US?
2014-10-09T04:06:50  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Apparently, if you're self employed? Automatic +10% to taxes
2014-10-09T04:06:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> make money
2014-10-09T04:07:16  <cosmo> i dunno about that, 10% seems like a lot
2014-10-09T04:07:23  <Wolf|WinLaptop> No questions asked - just because you can profit without being a replaceable worker means you get robbed
2014-10-09T04:07:26  <cosmo> and if you're under a certain income bracket you don't pay any income taxes anyway
2014-10-09T04:07:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Well, I think it depends on your tax bracket
2014-10-09T04:07:42  <Wolf|WinLaptop> but it's around that much for some
2014-10-09T04:07:53  <cosmo> yeah
2014-10-09T04:07:56  <Wolf|WinLaptop> automatically, you pay more, just for being self-employed
2014-10-09T04:08:59  <cosmo> there's a reason the phrase goes 'death & taxes' and not the other way around
2014-10-09T04:10:36  <cosmo> the most we can amount to are two dopes talking about whatever cuz actually changing things? lol
2014-10-09T04:11:06  <cosmo> most people will never change their opinions, gotta let the cycle of death and rebirth carry the weight
2014-10-09T04:11:13  <cosmo> would you like a pamphlet
2014-10-09T04:11:22  <cosmo> about how we're all fucked
2014-10-09T04:11:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Nope - I'm just leaving
2014-10-09T04:11:46  <cosmo> maybe we could start a religion and avoid taxes that way
2014-10-09T04:12:09  <cosmo> yeah sorry i'm not the most motivating
2014-10-09T04:12:14  <Wolf|WinLaptop> There are places who use taxes for shit other than invading other countries and murdering people.
2014-10-09T04:12:19  <Wolf|WinLaptop> No, I mean, the US lol
2014-10-09T04:12:30  <cosmo> ehh..
2014-10-09T04:12:34  <cosmo> canada might be a good bet
2014-10-09T04:12:41  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Canada is just all right.
2014-10-09T04:12:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Sweden is pretty fantastic
2014-10-09T04:13:02  <cosmo> so long as you're willing to work for yourself you can get by anywhere
2014-10-09T04:13:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> There are others in Europe that aren't totally retarded, too
2014-10-09T04:13:10  <Wolf|WinLaptop> That's the plan.
2014-10-09T04:13:11  <cosmo> maybe go to europe and get that sweet college deal
2014-10-09T04:13:19  <cosmo> that's life
2014-10-09T04:14:32  <cosmo> at least totalitarian rule is no longer a thing in most places
2014-10-09T04:15:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Meh - college is going mostly to get a piece of paper - yes, you learn shit, and nobody likes learning shit more than me - but you pay out the ass for it, and hoping your degree gets you a job to pay off the loan doesn't sound smart to me
2014-10-09T04:16:14  <cosmo> the european system is actually pretty decent
2014-10-09T04:16:28  <cosmo> only if you make more than 21k euros a year are you demanded to pay back the loan
2014-10-09T04:16:36  <cosmo> and after 30 years it's automatically forgiven
2014-10-09T04:16:47  <cosmo> don't even try in the US, they'll ball and chain you for life.
2014-10-09T04:16:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> nice
2014-10-09T04:16:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> yeah
2014-10-09T04:17:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I like what I do, though
2014-10-09T04:17:15  <cosmo> hey just build a portfolio
2014-10-09T04:17:15  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I dev stuff I like to dev
2014-10-09T04:17:18  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and then people come to me
2014-10-09T04:17:36  <cosmo> yeah, be like hashengineering, he gets paid to port android wallets to altcoins
2014-10-09T04:17:53  <cosmo> make your name known
2014-10-09T04:17:57  <cosmo> Wolf Industries
2014-10-09T04:18:24  <cosmo> name brand that shit
2014-10-09T04:18:40  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol, a business may be a good idea at some point, but not now
2014-10-09T04:19:12  <cosmo> why not?
2014-10-09T04:20:22  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Too young, too little cash, and experience
2014-10-09T04:20:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I want to have money put away for myself
2014-10-09T04:20:38  <Wolf|WinLaptop> before I look into some shit like that
2014-10-09T04:20:51  <cosmo> i don't think it costs anything
2014-10-09T04:21:05  <cosmo> besides registration fees and whatnot, which isn't all that expensive anyway
2014-10-09T04:21:15  <cosmo> plus you can take tax deductions for business use
2014-10-09T04:21:26  <Wolf|WinLaptop> cosmo: Not much gain, either - and I already get that for being self-employed
2014-10-09T04:21:45  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Plus, self-employment means I can deduct rent from profit as an expense
2014-10-09T04:21:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> since I work here
2014-10-09T04:22:24  <cosmo> ya already had to go through july 14th?
2014-10-09T04:22:32  <cosmo> filing the forms
2014-10-09T04:24:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Not yet
2014-10-09T04:24:48  <Wolf|WinLaptop> But I've looked into it
2014-10-09T04:25:37  <cosmo> cool
2014-10-09T04:25:55  <cosmo> they're not too bad, but then again i've been a dependant my whole life so they were simple
2014-10-09T04:28:19  <cosmo> you'll be fine. see if you can find a farm that'll sponser you in a work-visa type thing
2014-10-09T04:28:40  <Wolf`> tbh, I just want to leave the US, but not enough money yet. I need a decent amount to live off of in case I don't get work for a while
2014-10-09T04:29:00  *** Dreday00 <Dreday00!~ssdre@24.104.211.174> has quit IRC (Quit: Leaving)
2014-10-09T04:30:08  <cosmo> yep
2014-10-09T04:30:18  <cosmo> this is where friendship comes in real handy
2014-10-09T04:30:26  <cosmo> people'll let you crash on their couch for a month or so
2014-10-09T04:30:33  <cosmo> till you find a place to stand
2014-10-09T04:30:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> yeah
2014-10-09T04:31:03  <cosmo> who'd believe it's possible to get through life on mutual kindness after getting fucked by the system their whole lives
2014-10-09T04:31:14  <cosmo> not many. but it's true.
2014-10-09T04:31:25  <cosmo> and it's gonna be a rough coupla centuries as people learn the hard way.
2014-10-09T04:34:44  <Trenal> its who you know, not what
2014-10-09T04:34:49  <Wolf|WinLaptop> You gotta make the system work for you.
2014-10-09T04:35:00  <Wolf|WinLaptop> and yeah
2014-10-09T04:35:04  <Wolf|WinLaptop> people are very helpful
2014-10-09T04:37:02  <Trenal> if you had coding skills cosmos I always need java,javascripy and php help =)
2014-10-09T04:38:41  <cosmo> i should pick it up
2014-10-09T04:39:28  <cosmo> something i thought'd be neat, is a program that analyzed coin source code and made a chart for % difference from what it was forked from
2014-10-09T04:39:37  <Trenal> wish i could find a reliable cheap indian for work related java stuff
2014-10-09T04:39:46  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol
2014-10-09T04:39:54  <cosmo> so you'd start with BTC as a root and all those branches out, going from black to white on the spectrum

2014-10-09T04:46:08  <CptSoloMiner> my grandfather owned a music caf in Karlstad in the 60s
2014-10-09T04:47:02  <CptSoloMiner> he used to own a lot of business, then he got into the wrong kind of business and died pennyless :-/
2014-10-09T04:47:18  <Trenal> sounds like the US
2014-10-09T04:47:54  <CptSoloMiner> didn't inherit one cent from him, which is a pity

2014-10-09T06:34:33  <vinje> yep
2014-10-09T06:34:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I'z bored
2014-10-09T06:34:57  <vinje> and I just sympathy yawned at you typing yawn.  htf does that work
2014-10-09T06:35:31  <Wolf|WinLaptop> lol
2014-10-09T06:35:34  <Wolf|WinLaptop> no idea
2014-10-09T06:35:52  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I finally tested clocks and volts I'd run 24/7, though
2014-10-09T06:37:17  <Wolf`> 270X at 1050mV
2014-10-09T06:37:34  <Wolf`> 7950 at 1087mV, 280X at the same
2014-10-09T06:37:59  <Wolf`> 290X I put at 1162.5mV
2014-10-09T06:38:27  <Wolf`> Could have dropped it to 1112.5, but it was a total dog at that voltage
2014-10-09T06:40:06  <Wolf|WinLaptop> 270X did 3.33MH/s, the 290X 6.87MH/s, my 7950 4.66MH/s and my older Dual-X 280X doing 5.28MH/s, all X11. Total for the rig was therefore about 20MH/s.
2014-10-09T06:40:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Power used at the wall was 655W
2014-10-09T06:40:30  <Wolf|WinLaptop> For reference, with high clocks and overvolting, I hit 23MH/s using 990W
2014-10-09T06:42:35  <Wolf|WinLaptop> And, of course, screenshot of the cards mining, all undervolted. I love those temps; a 290X mining at under 65C is incredible for me: Screenshot (NSFW): https://ottrbutt.com/miner/x11localrigwolf-lowpower-10092014.png

2014-10-09T12:59:15  <Trenal> nothing is going to stop altcoins, they just may never amount to anything likeBTC
2014-10-09T12:59:28  <Trenal> just niche communities using them
2014-10-09T13:09:43  <Wolf|WinLaptop> So true
2014-10-09T13:09:54  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Well, I doubt it
2014-10-09T13:10:07  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I think at least a couple will amount to something
2014-10-09T13:10:13  <Wolf|WinLaptop> BTC is a proof of concept
2014-10-09T13:10:15  <RunningmanZ> maybe maybe not. Kinda like currency where certain countries are worth more than others
2014-10-09T13:10:25  <Wolf|WinLaptop> it's messy and it has loads of issues
2014-10-09T13:10:47  <Wolf|WinLaptop> I think another coin will eventually become popular
2014-10-09T13:11:02  <RunningmanZ> all it takes is a big flaw in BTC and some scare mongering and anotehr alt could rise up
2014-10-09T13:11:55  <Wolf|WinLaptop> Any core flaw in BTC will affect 99.9% of alts
2014-10-09T13:13:54  <RunningmanZ> damn this toasted chicken sandwich is hitting the spot. Toasted with mozerella cheese, onion powder, salt/pepper and some honey mustard sauce :P

2014-10-09T13:38:07  <kenel-work> maybe it's because i'm rending it as an mp4
2014-10-09T13:38:12  <kenel-work> maybe just simple avi is ok
2014-10-09T13:38:14  <Trenal> that is what  google is for
2014-10-09T13:38:20  <Trenal> I only have used premiere

2014-10-09T17:49:54  <cosmo> have fun n stuff
2014-10-09T17:53:08  <Wolf`> oh my god
2014-10-09T17:53:14  <Wolf`> why did I not see this
2014-10-09T17:53:17  <Wolf`> oh, I know
2014-10-09T17:53:35  <Wolf`> because deciphering this mess of macros using macros using macros took all my attention
2014-10-09T17:53:57  <Wolf`> This is very simply solved - shit, damned near ideal for - vectors...
2014-10-09T17:54:21  <Wolf`> Two vectors of 8 64-bit integers and you are good to go.
2014-10-09T17:55:13  <cosmo> bill bill bill bill bill bill bill bill

2014-10-09T17:55:32  <cosmo> *wicked guitar solo*
2014-10-09T17:55:44  <Wolf`> lol
2014-10-09T17:56:25  <Wolf`> seriously, this dude uses macros to concatenate bits of text into strings - which becomes another macro
2014-10-09T17:56:36  <Wolf`> abusing the fuck outta the preprocessor lol
2014-10-09T17:56:55  <Wolf`> best part is
2014-10-09T17:57:15  <Wolf`> that macro resolves to a number - which is then concatenated with a letter to make a variable name
2014-10-09T17:57:18  <Wolf`> >.<
2014-10-09T17:57:43  <Wolf`> All you had to fuckin' do was use a uint8 for that variable and call shuffle()
2014-10-09T17:57:46  <Wolf`> done.
2014-10-09T18:08:14  <cosmo> the world is saved?
2014-10-09T18:08:37  <Wolf`> cosmo: well, shit will likely be faster
2014-10-09T18:08:44  <Wolf`> there's just one thing I dunno about
2014-10-09T18:09:01  <Wolf`> each 64-bit word has to be rotated by a different amount
2014-10-09T18:09:08  <Wolf`> Vectors are not gonna like that shit
2014-10-09T18:09:16  <Wolf`> which is why it's *almost* idea

2014-10-09T19:28:45  <Wolf`> I really only vectorized one operation that's not done often, and it's noticeably faster.

2014-10-09T21:04:01  <Rickus> bluescreens are usually due to undervolting, right?
2014-10-09T21:04:17  <Rickus> (from my experience)
2014-10-09T21:04:25  <Wolf`> no - too high clocks

2014-10-10T02:30:52  <RunningmanZ> hehe cool. I'm just about to sign up to Steam and grab it
2014-10-10T02:30:58  <cosmo> well i aint buyin em dre
2014-10-10T02:30:59  <Wolf`> Okay
2014-10-10T02:31:24  <Wolf`> Well, I vectorized Skein really well, considering I thought it was near ideal for vectors and it turned out it was just all right.
2014-10-10T02:31:44  <RunningmanZ> I just requested Haas add support for thier bot on BTC38.com so I can trade DGC with it. Cmooon :D
2014-10-10T02:32:10  <Wolf`> Skein is fast, though - it made an impact, but not much over the margin of error, as the percentage of time spent on Skein in X11 is likely low.
2014-10-10T02:32:27  <Wolf`> Soooo... I think Groestl is a great candidate for vectorization, but it'll take a lot of work
2014-10-10T02:32:33  <Wolf`> I'd better be right :P
2014-10-10T02:32:37  <Wolf`> It's fuck slow
2014-10-10T02:32:44  <Wolf`> so a large percentage of X11
2014-10-10T02:32:47  <Wolf`> second only to SIMD

2014-10-10T02:41:17  <Dreday00> vectorization?
2014-10-10T02:41:35  <Dreday00> comso I think I have to give them out as gifts
2014-10-10T02:49:10  <Wolf`> Dreday00: the use of vectors - they're sort of like arrays, but they function as a unit
2014-10-10T02:49:38  <Wolf`> were I to add two arrays, I would have to use a loop, adding each member of each array and storing it - individually
2014-10-10T02:49:49  <Wolf`> Vectors allow it to be done in a single operation
2014-10-10T02:52:56  <Dreday00> So these algos are not "vectored"
2014-10-10T02:53:05  <Wolf`> Nope
2014-10-10T02:53:36  <Dreday00> is that by choice?
2014-10-10T02:53:49  <Wolf`> lol, this will replace 120 lines of code with 8. If this works it will be epic.
2014-10-10T02:53:52  <Wolf`> Nope
2014-10-10T02:54:04  <Wolf`> Understand - this is copy+pasted code meant for a CPU
2014-10-10T02:54:14  <Wolf`> the people who did this know nothing about GPUs
2014-10-10T02:54:16  <Wolf`> at all
2014-10-10T02:55:54  <Dreday00> I really thought that the newer algos were made for gpus
2014-10-10T02:56:13  <Wolf`> they are - they're made to be more efficient on GPU than CPU
2014-10-10T02:56:28  <Dreday00> but originally made for cpus
2014-10-10T02:56:35  <Wolf`> Right
2014-10-10T02:57:22  <Dreday00> so you are in a sense compressing code
2014-10-10T02:58:29  <Wolf`> Nope - I'm making it run faster by allowing the GPU to do certain things it's good at. Like my adding example - say an add is two clock cycles, a CPU would have to waste 32 clocks adding an array of 16 integers
2014-10-10T02:58:40  <Wolf`> A GPU, if a vector were used
2014-10-10T02:58:43  <Wolf`> can do it in two
2014-10-10T02:58:47  <Wolf`> all at once
2014-10-10T02:59:00  <Wolf`> side effect is making the code cleaner
2014-10-10T02:59:50  <Dreday00> what are gpus better at than cpus?
2014-10-10T02:59:58  <Dreday00> more cores?
2014-10-10T03:00:38  <Wolf`> Yep! They are EXTREMELY good at doing simple tasks that add up to a big task - 290X has 2816 shaders, or cores, while a CPU has like four or eight
2014-10-10T03:00:52  <Wolf`> Thing is, those cores are fuckin' stupid
2014-10-10T03:01:18  <Wolf`> they're slow and they don't handle decisions well (branches, if this then that, otherwise that other shit)
2014-10-10T03:01:53  <Wolf`> basically perfect for most hashes - most complex hashes can be done using several threads to compute one hash - this was not done either
2014-10-10T03:02:39  <Dreday00> so theres one vector per shader?
2014-10-10T03:03:33  <Wolf`> no, vectors are basically storage like arrays that are a fixed size - bonus is, if you're doing the same operation to all, it can be done at once. But this is within one shader
2014-10-10T03:03:47  <Dreday00> Oh
2014-10-10T03:04:05  <Wolf`> I could do 2816 * 16 adds pretty much instantly with a 290X, in theory.
2014-10-10T03:04:24  <Dreday00> Ok so in the case of scrypt  why does it get so damned hot
2014-10-10T03:06:39  <Wolf`> Dreday00: Because the code is well done - it keeps most of the shaders busy with work constantly. Any chip doing work full out constantly is gonna get hot
2014-10-10T03:06:44  <Wolf`> and draw more power
2014-10-10T03:07:06  <Wolf`> X11 kernel sucks so hard that most of the shaders probably are doing jack shit at any given moment
2014-10-10T03:07:13  <Wolf`> So of course it'll run cooler
2014-10-10T03:07:26  <Wolf`> like a quarter of the goddamned GPU is probably idle lol
2014-10-10T03:07:33  <Dreday00> Oh ok so then why is the hash higher?
2014-10-10T03:09:23  <Wolf`> Hash is higher because it takes less time to get through an X11 hash - more computations need to be done.
2014-10-10T03:09:36  <Wolf`> They just botched the code so bad those computations take ages
2014-10-10T03:12:29  * Dreday00 almost done with a 24oz Coors original  and I am pleasantly buzzed
2014-10-10T03:13:22  * Wolf` has taken 2x30mg pills of amphetamine and is pleasantly high.
2014-10-10T03:13:26  <Dreday00> DO you think x11 was made just to get the hashrate to look better
2014-10-10T03:13:34  <Wolf`> working on this shit. And nah
2014-10-10T03:13:55  <Wolf`> it was made because they mistakenly though more algos and complexity equals ASIC resistance
2014-10-10T03:13:58  <Wolf`> it doesn't
2014-10-10T03:14:13  <Dreday00> Ok I see I see
2014-10-10T03:16:46  <Dreday00> So essentially if a algo can make a gpu rig as power efficient as a asic  Asics wouldn't be such a threat
2014-10-10T03:17:27  <Dreday00> I think my smart guy timer is almost run out :)
2014-10-10T03:19:18  <Wolf`> Dreday00: You can never do that - but if you can get close enough, then yeah
2014-10-10T03:19:32  <Wolf`> because an ASIC takes money to design and build
2014-10-10T03:19:39  <Dreday00> i meant to say close

2014-10-13T01:01:26  <Guest48262> no support ARG?
2014-10-13T01:01:39  <samson_> I have a feeling it will make a comeback
2014-10-13T01:01:59  <Guest48262> who?
2014-10-13T01:02:28  <samson_> I'm working on a few things with DGC over the next couple of months, once they're done they could be applied to ARG and SRC
2014-10-13T01:02:55  <Guest48262> I am ready to work with ARG as a perspective coin, but nobody does not support it
2014-10-13T01:03:28  <samson_> It's an old chain, who knows - maybe it will be merge mined with something else
2014-10-13T01:03:44  <duuuuude> the foundation people just arnt here right now, they will probably have more answeres
2014-10-13T01:04:08  <samson_> I'm in the foundation and it has been discussed a little
2014-10-13T01:04:14  <Guest48262> who can restore the block explorer ARG?
2014-10-13T01:04:22  <samson_> You can
2014-10-13T01:04:30  <samson_> So can anyone else
2014-10-13T01:05:18  <samson_> My work with blockchains will include building full indexes of all transactions so once it's complete I could potentially produce a back end for a block explorer for any of the coins
2014-10-13T01:06:20  <Guest48262> to @samson_ I do not know
2014-10-13T01:07:05  <Guest48262> @samson_ When?

2014-10-13T01:07:22  <Guest48262> to @samson_ When?
2014-10-13T01:07:34  <samson_> I'm a busy guy and fit things in when I can
2014-10-13T01:08:46  <Guest48262> How much will it cost to do it fast?
2014-10-13T01:11:14  <samson_> Was is joeyjones who had https://altexplorer.net/ running at one point ?
2014-10-13T01:11:41  <cosmon> i hold some ARG
2014-10-13T01:12:18  <cosmon> Guest48262,  what is your interest in ARG?
2014-10-13T01:12:23  <samson_> he used to come in here quite a bit
2014-10-13T01:12:38  <samson_> I still have about 150k ARG
2014-10-13T01:12:47  <Guest48262> i hold a lot of ARG
2014-10-13T01:13:14  <Guest48262> ~400k ARG
2014-10-13T01:14:29  <samson_> find the previous explorer operators and get them to reopen it
2014-10-13T01:14:30  <Guest48262> who can restore the block explorer ARG and how much will it cost?
2014-10-13T01:15:15  <samson_> You're going to have to find that out for yourself - your starting point is the user joeyjones
2014-10-13T01:15:55  <samson_> Most of the work that's happening right now is being concentrated on DGC
2014-10-13T01:16:14  <samson_> Once that's done I suspect people will move onto the other coins
2014-10-13T01:16:28  <Guest48262> when it can be here?
2014-10-13T01:16:55  <samson_> You in a hurry ?
2014-10-13T01:17:13  <samson_> Patience pays in the long run
2014-10-13T01:18:04  <cosmon> i've got about 30k arg :p
2014-10-13T01:18:13  <cosmon> should get everyone together and pump dat shit
2014-10-13T01:19:18  <Guest48262> I want to work with the ARG, but for this I need block explorer
2014-10-13T01:20:08  <samson_> Most of the guys are away for the conference in Vegas right now, in a few days they will be back here
2014-10-13T01:20:34  <Guest48262> I can buy all your ARG at the current price for Paypal
2014-10-13T01:20:39  <samson_> There is a forum at digitalcoin.co which has a section on ARG
2014-10-13T01:21:11  <cosmon> lol i'm good Guest48262
2014-10-13T01:21:20  <samson_> Yeah and I could buy all of the arg (every coin) for 100% non trustable paypal
2014-10-13T01:21:22  <cosmon> a guy on bitcointalk bout 600k ARG a while ago
2014-10-13T01:22:23  <samson_> Nobody will ever sell you anything for paypal
2014-10-13T01:22:33  <Wolf`> samson_: not true
2014-10-13T01:22:39  <samson_> Unless they're a noob
2014-10-13T01:22:43  <Wolf`> just gotta stick to people you know well
2014-10-13T01:22:46  <samson_> Or there's serious trust
2014-10-13T01:22:49  <Wolf`> yep
2014-10-13T01:22:51  <samson_> That's the thing

2014-10-13T01:23:11  <Guest48262> i can for BTC
2014-10-13T01:23:15  <Wolf`> lol, definitely
2014-10-13T01:23:43  <samson_> Anyway, I'm not selling mine, if anything I'll be buying more once the DGC mint rate changes with the introduction of DGC v3
2014-10-13T01:24:46  <Wolf`> I'm waiting for v3, as well

2014-10-13T15:48:15  <CptSoloMiner> that's odd
2014-10-13T15:48:25  <CptSoloMiner> if I go into the price guide website
2014-10-13T15:48:27  <Wolf`> then again, I bought it for the 860M, so I could do CUDA dev on the go
2014-10-13T15:48:28  <CptSoloMiner> that's 80%
2014-10-13T15:49:06  <Wolf`> Well, yeah
2014-10-13T15:49:15  <Wolf`> looking at cheap shit, expect to find cheap shit lol
2014-10-13T15:49:15  <CptSoloMiner> sorry I'm wrong it's 1400/2800
2014-10-13T15:49:23  <CptSoloMiner> but theose are the cheaper ones
2014-10-13T15:49:26  <CptSoloMiner> those 1400
2014-10-13T15:49:51  <CptSoloMiner> 1080p is 681 out of 2800
2014-10-13T15:49:59  <CptSoloMiner> at ANY price
2014-10-13T15:50:00  <Wolf`> if it doesn't have an i5 (not a crappy i5), then it's probably gonna cheap out on the screen, too
2014-10-13T15:51:06  <CptSoloMiner> but it's like ALL the acer, etc have the TN 1366 screens, IF they are around $500
2014-10-13T15:51:19  <CptSoloMiner> there is a Lenovo 2-in-1 1920x1200 10 inch
2014-10-13T15:51:25  <CptSoloMiner> for 300
2014-10-13T15:51:32  <Wolf`> hm... odd
2014-10-13T15:51:33  <CptSoloMiner> win 8.1
2014-10-13T15:51:57  <Wolf`> I still remember what I paid for the laptop I'm on
2014-10-13T15:52:02  <CptSoloMiner> maybe in 2010 1080p screens were premium
2014-10-13T15:52:07  <CptSoloMiner> but in late 2014?!?!
2014-10-13T15:52:09  <Wolf`> Got it in June, was $1,340 with one-day shipping
2014-10-13T15:52:16  <Trenal> I pay 40 hours a week for my laptop
2014-10-13T15:52:17  <Wolf`> Worth it, though
2014-10-13T15:52:29  <CptSoloMiner> you can get 1920x1200 on the nvidia shield tablet
2014-10-13T15:52:30  <CptSoloMiner> 8 inch
2014-10-13T15:52:32  <CptSoloMiner> for $299
2014-10-13T15:52:38  <CptSoloMiner> Gawd!!!
2014-10-13T15:52:44  <Wolf`> Trenal: that thing had better be a quantum computer

2014-10-13T21:27:52  <Wolf`> hey, ahmed_
2014-10-13T21:30:31  <ahmed_> Hey Wolf`
2014-10-13T21:38:33  <kenel-work> windows 9 is being released for free to everyone that has windows 8 aparently
2014-10-13T21:38:38  <kenel-work> so windows 10 is the next paid version
2014-10-13T21:46:58  <joeyjones> kenel-work: windows 9 may be windows 10 actually
2014-10-13T21:47:16  <joeyjones> some sort of a naming issue with version 9 being NT or something
2014-10-13T21:47:49  <joeyjones> When I last found that info the free upgrade is only for purchased copies, not OEM.  OEM will have a small upgrade fee.
2014-10-13T21:58:18  <techbytes> kenel-work, how did you install drivers for your raspi to work with the zeus x3?  I'm running the latest raspi image from zeus.
2014-10-13T21:58:35  <kenel-work> i don't have it hooked up to a rapsi; i have it hooked up to one of my old miners
2014-10-13T21:58:52  <techbytes> oh..
2014-10-13T21:59:05  <kenel-work> the other one i can't run yet because it's not cold enough outside
2014-10-13T21:59:10  <kenel-work> and the backoffice gets like 100+f
2014-10-13T21:59:41  <techbytes> i started up the raspi and getting "can not detect miner"
2014-10-13T21:59:54  <kenel-work> is it hotplugged?
2014-10-13T22:00:04  <kenel-work> might have to plug/unplug it while it's on?
2014-10-13T22:00:21  <kenel-work> or make sure you're not using the image for the newer miners, i don't think that works
2014-10-13T22:01:26  <ahmed_> joeyjones: looks like it
2014-10-13T22:01:43  <kenel-work> hey ahmed_ do i have to buy nfc tags for this wallet to work?
2014-10-13T22:01:45  <ahmed_> got a dreamspark premium account so going to see the dev preview copy of win 10
2014-10-13T22:01:46  <kenel-work> that's what it looks like
2014-10-13T22:02:03  <kenel-work> or wtf i can't get this goddamn thing to work
2014-10-13T22:02:06  <ahmed_> hey kenel-work. the keychain wallet right?
2014-10-13T22:02:09  <kenel-work> yeah
2014-10-13T22:02:13  <ahmed_> its a NFC tag itself
2014-10-13T22:02:27  <ahmed_> dont know exactly how it works tho
2014-10-13T22:02:28  <kenel-work> it just pops up that same screen that says 'new tag scanned' empty tag
2014-10-13T22:02:59  <ahmed_> hmm. it shouldnt be an empty tag
2014-10-13T22:03:06  <kenel-work> maybe i need an app that understands what to do with it?
2014-10-13T22:03:30  <ahmed_> you did buy it right :P
2014-10-13T22:04:10  <ahmed_> for real tho i have no idea. will ask marshall
2014-10-13T22:04:27  <kenel-work> yes i bought it but it's not like anyone loaded it or anything after i bought it
2014-10-13T22:04:47  <ahmed_> it should have been preloaded with 0.1 btc i think
2014-10-13T22:05:16  <kenel-work> i know it should have been
2014-10-13T22:05:18  <kenel-work> but it doesn't look like it was
2014-10-13T22:05:26  <ahmed_> yup
2014-10-13T22:06:28  <kenel-work> so marshall made off with my money!!! :P

2014-10-13T22:10:01  <ahmed_> tom's shows bitcoin wallet when he scanned it in front of me
2014-10-13T22:12:05  <kenel-work> fuckin fuck.
2014-10-13T22:12:11  <kenel-work> tom didn't have the keychain one he just had the coin one
2014-10-13T22:12:17  <kenel-work> there was two different ones right?
2014-10-13T22:12:20  <ahmed_> ahh yea
2014-10-13T22:12:33  <kenel-work> i wear my keys on my pants like a balla
2014-10-13T22:12:38  <kenel-work> hence me wanting keychain one
2014-10-13T22:12:56  <kenel-work> well wtf, how can i make this a wallet then
2014-10-13T22:13:08  <kenel-work> it's obviously got nothing on it now
2014-10-13T22:14:28  <kenel-work> going to use the keychain as a cold wallet :P
2014-10-13T22:14:54  <ahmed_> kenel-work: should be possible
2014-10-13T22:14:58  <ahmed_> its just a NFC tag

2014-10-13T23:01:50  <kenel-work> i can't seem to get the blockchain wallet to work with it for the life of me
2014-10-13T23:02:02  <bittrex-ryan> logs all the keys!
2014-10-13T23:02:13  <kenel-work> huh?
2014-10-13T23:02:23  <kenel-work> i haven't actually put bitcoin on anything yet, i'm just fucking around with different things
2014-10-13T23:03:27  <bittrex-ryan> i'm just kidding
2014-10-13T23:03:33  <bittrex-ryan> when shit doesn't work I assume its logging all the keys
2014-10-13T23:04:10  <kenel-work> so bascially i can use this NFC tag to encrypt/decrypt the aegis wallet
2014-10-13T23:04:17  <kenel-work> i'm assuming when it's encrypted nothing can be sent in/out
2014-10-13T23:04:21  <kenel-work> i'll have to test it

2014-10-14T00:11:39  <duuuuude> you can get shows 8 to 10 times faster
2014-10-14T00:12:13  <duuuuude> if you already knew that, then sorry
2014-10-14T00:12:52  <samson_> I just get the torrents on to a server than download them to my PC
2014-10-14T00:13:04  <duuuuude> oh i see
2014-10-14T00:13:12  <samson_> I'm in no hurry, I have dozens of programs stacked up to watch
2014-10-14T00:26:07  <bittrex-ryan> i haven't used irc to get stuff since like 2001
2014-10-14T00:26:26  <bittrex-ryan> i remember hanging out in phrozencrew and just typing !search name_of_software
2014-10-14T00:26:56  <duuuuude> yeah i still use the !search function, its !s now but its the same thing
2014-10-14T00:28:53  <bittrex-ryan> I just haven't been on the main network for that in forever
2014-10-14T00:28:59  <bittrex-ryan> I figured it had died out by now, guess not
2014-10-14T00:29:17  <bittrex-ryan> still more secure doing it through the thing that shall not be mentioned
2014-10-14T00:29:18  <bittrex-ryan> :)

2014-10-14T00:37:15  <RunningmanZ> Everyone should use Sickbeard ;)
2014-10-14T00:37:35  <RunningmanZ> I checked and Sickbeard had already downloaded it and places it in the Walking Dead directory for me :D
2014-10-14T00:37:51  <RunningmanZ> Have to wait till I get home now to watch :(

2014-10-14T00:38:54  <RunningmanZ> :D :D
2014-10-14T00:43:21  <bittrex-ryan> RunningmanZ,
2014-10-14T00:43:27  <bittrex-ryan> don't talk about things like that
2014-10-14T00:43:45  <bittrex-ryan> I don't use sickbeard, i already had sab configured and it works fine, if sab dies on me I'll build my stuff with sickbeard
2014-10-14T00:44:38  <bittrex-ryan> hehe we don't talk about the things that are soo good, the others will catch on and it will be regulated and we will have to pay outragous prices for comcast to take the free signal, compress it and send us crappy hd :P

2014-10-14T00:54:12  <RunningmanZ> Yeah Sab works in conjuction with Sickbeard. Sickbeard gets the torrents and passes them to Sab for d/l, then Sickbeard moves the files to the correct folders etc :D
2014-10-14T00:55:25  <RunningmanZ> Well I succumbed and created a Steam account. Bought Alien Isolation. been playing it on the Oculus Rift DK2.

2014-10-14T01:07:14  <Wolf`> Ugh... how to work this...
2014-10-14T01:07:24  <Wolf`> FFT256 really should be in its own OpenCL kernel
2014-10-14T01:07:53  <Wolf`> sharing one with the main SIMD compression means I'm starved for registers and it increases the complexity insanely
2014-10-14T01:08:18  <Wolf`> But then again, to put it in its own, I need to modify SGminer, which I'm trying to avoid doing...
2014-10-14T01:09:59  <duuuuude> i would think with the mods you do you would already have yoru own version of sgminer
2014-10-14T01:10:12  <Wolf`> duuuuude: the code to sgminer is awful
2014-10-14T01:10:18  <Wolf`> and I dun wanna touch it lol
2014-10-14T01:10:20  <Wolf`> horrid
2014-10-14T01:10:21  <duuuuude> oh i get you
2014-10-14T01:10:24  <Wolf`> no organization
2014-10-14T01:10:31  <Wolf`> wait a fuckin' minute
2014-10-14T01:10:49  <Wolf`> these four massive rounds don't rely on the previous state...
2014-10-14T01:10:54  <Wolf`> and they don't use x, only q
2014-10-14T01:11:01  <Wolf`> and q just became a constant...
2014-10-14T01:11:09  <Wolf`> motherfucker, I can precompute this shit :D
2014-10-14T01:25:36  <Wolf`> wait, no, fuck
2014-10-14T01:25:55  <Wolf`> they do rely on prev. state, upon further inspection

2014-10-14T05:15:32  <Dreday00> Sorry
2014-10-14T05:15:34  <Dreday00> lol

2014-10-14T05:16:42  <Rickus> plus I wanted to punch Putin for sticking his ugly mug in every opporunity. what a megalomaniac!
2014-10-14T05:17:23  <Rickus> Ros really is making stupid mistakes/moves lately.
2014-10-14T05:18:01  <Rickus> he recovered with an awesome drive, but man, what a downer of a race that could have been good.
2014-10-14T05:18:16  <Rickus> but yeah, the tires were all wrong.

2014-10-14T05:42:11  <RunningmanZ> Rickus:Yeah and the DRS zone was not long enough. I think the detection needed to be further back. cars couldn't pass under DRS. Ricciardo was stuck behind Vettel and esp Alonso which stuffed him up a bit too.
2014-10-14T06:00:27  <joeyjones> hey RunningmanZ do you have any 280xs?
2014-10-14T06:03:21  <RunningmanZ> nah i don't mine at all just trade and buy dgc :D

2014-10-14T06:29:52  <Rickus> joey, i've got 7970s, why?
2014-10-14T06:30:51  <Rickus> rz: hmm, true. I still think DRS is a silly device to get more passing in artificially
2014-10-14T06:33:08  <Rickus> imo, reduce the front and rear wings even further and increase tire grip.
2014-10-14T06:34:59  <Rickus> That would reduce the dependence on downforce and emphasis raw mechanical grip. Makes for great racing in other formula classes.

2014-10-14T15:13:05  <techbytes-lenovo> maybe xawksow_ can add the option to do that if there is such an option.
2014-10-14T15:15:41  <TTsquared> Under profile there's options to add icq, aim, skype, etc. Maybe there.
2014-10-14T15:16:57  <TTsquared> I know I'm not the only one that uses a different handle in irc and on the forum.

2014-10-14T17:06:53  <Rickus> joeyjones: yup, 2 of my ref 7970s did that - is it a reference design?
2014-10-14T17:09:32  <Rickus> joey: if it is, it's the fan shroud contacting the blower. I ended up dremeling off 1/2 a mm to give it more play. Alternatively, you can remove the screws closest to the fan and wedge something between the shroud and the pcb so it gives it more room.
2014-10-14T17:10:25  <Rickus> the fan bearings were good on both.

2014-10-14T21:37:06  <Wolf`> hm... 6MH/s out of 280X on X11
2014-10-14T21:37:10  <Wolf`> not good enough yet
2014-10-14T21:37:55  <Wolf`> Fixing this franchise-sized fuckup they call an SIMD implementation is not easy
2014-10-14T21:38:55  <bittrex-ryan> what are people getting out of them?
2014-10-14T21:39:05  <bittrex-ryan> I had 4.2 or somethin easily without any tweaks a couple mnths ago
2014-10-14T21:39:15  <bittrex-ryan> still not worth it thoug, selling my gpu's 1 by 1
2014-10-14T21:39:16  <Wolf`> bittrex-ryan: Best public one is badman74's fork - 4.3MH/s is what he says is best
2014-10-14T21:39:40  <Wolf`> I've got 6MH/s so far, but the real bottleneck is SIMD
2014-10-14T21:39:52  <Wolf`> should work loads better if I can un-fuck that
2014-10-14T21:40:14  <bittrex-ryan> what is simd?
2014-10-14T21:40:38  <bittrex-ryan> i hate selling my gpus :(
2014-10-14T21:40:46  <bittrex-ryan> was hoping scrypt would be worth it this winter to heat my hous e:)
2014-10-14T21:41:20  <Wolf`> bittrex-ryan: SIMD is one of the hashes in X11
2014-10-14T21:44:02  <Rickus> hey wolf: Rickus> wolf: best efficiency I got on my rig with x11 is 3.66 MH/s per card (11 MH/s total) at 370 W = 0.0297 MH/W
2014-10-14T21:44:39  <Wolf`> Rickus: hm?
2014-10-14T21:45:06  <Rickus> 7970s - That's at 0.969V - 900 MHz GPU / 1000 MHz mem.
2014-10-14T21:45:17  <Wolf`> not bad
2014-10-14T21:45:46  <Wolf`> my best was 20.3 for 640W, I think
2014-10-14T21:45:54  <Wolf`> across 270X, 280X, 290X, and 7950
2014-10-14T21:46:14  <Rickus> anything above that speed requires more voltage and eff drops big time
2014-10-14T21:46:30  <Wolf`> 0.032MH/s per W
2014-10-14T21:48:24  <Rickus> 4.3 is doable but consumes 550W - so 0.0235 MH/W - that's with badman's
2014-10-14T21:48:41  <Rickus> 4.3 x 3 that is
2014-10-14T21:48:54  <Wolf`> ah
2014-10-14T21:49:10  <Wolf`> yeah, 6MH/s is doable for me, but consumes quite a bit
2014-10-14T21:49:54  <duuuuude> hey does anyone remember what the hi speed port number at dgc,ranger its 1333 right?
2014-10-14T21:50:18  <bittrex-ryan> I have a bunch of 280x, 7970s, and 2 290s to sell
2014-10-14T21:51:21  <Rickus> I should increase the density of cards per rig now - be nice if I could manage 6 cards on one rig. I'd have to use two powersupplies = not so good.
2014-10-14T21:52:04  <Rickus> I won't be buying any more hw for a long time
2014-10-14T21:52:14  <duuuuude> i thought you can do 8 card per tower with the new amd mod
2014-10-14T21:56:03  <Rickus> I haven't heard of this - enlighten me?
2014-10-14T21:57:21  <duuuuude> i just read about in on bitcointalk, there is a new amd mod that lets you do 8 cards per tower wich is the windows limit. i also thought i read that there are people working on changing the windows limit also
2014-10-14T22:08:35  <bittrex-ryan> i've always had trouble keeping 4 running on windows

2014-10-14T22:38:28  <Wolf`> so never had that issue
2014-10-14T22:39:20  <Wolf`> four will definitely work on Win, though
2014-10-14T22:39:43  <Wolf`> the idiot gamers will more money than sense would throw a fit
2014-10-14T22:40:55  <bittrex-ryan> 4 works on the good mobos
2014-10-14T22:41:08  <bittrex-ryan> and it works on shitty mobos with some tweaking, they don't always give you which slots work with whatever configuration
2014-10-14T22:41:23  <bittrex-ryan> I just find sometimes a card would disappear and be a bitch to get back, usually just a riser going odd
2014-10-14T22:49:13  <Wolf`> ah
2014-10-14T22:49:23  <Wolf`> yeah, gamers usually use fuck expensive ones
2014-10-14T22:49:45  <bittrex-ryan> I have 2 good boards, well i just sold the sabertooth

2014-10-14T23:57:41  <wobbzz> I’ve been using it for a couple of years. raidz is pretty robust. I’m using ecryptfs on top of the volume for data at rest protection. I’m using it for a home storage server.

2014-10-14T23:59:24  <Rickus> wobbzz: nice, How do you have it setup? (ZIL, L2ARC, etc)
2014-10-15T00:01:01  <Rickus> I'm thinking of setting one up for a low-cost storage system.
2014-10-15T00:01:16  <wobbzz> Rickus: I’m not using either of those. I don’t think I’d really see worthwhile benefit using ZIL/L2ARC for home use. So just straight raidz across 3 drives.
2014-10-15T00:01:26  <Rickus> understood
2014-10-15T00:01:49  <Rickus> performance is decent though?
2014-10-15T00:01:50  <wobbzz> for a low cost storage system you’d be fine without them too
2014-10-15T00:02:00  <wobbzz> yeah, performance is great
2014-10-15T00:02:09  <wobbzz> I don’t have exact numbers for you
2014-10-15T00:02:44  <wobbzz> I’ve actually seen better performance rolling my own setups with gentoo/ubuntu vice using freenas
2014-10-15T00:03:23  <wobbzz> i think it had to do with the encryption methods freenas uses… raid-z on top of decrypted volumes… which is not a good idea.
2014-10-15T00:05:41  <Rickus> I'm looking to offer it to some hosted clients as a low cost, reliable high data density alternative to a more expensive SAN setup. Been reading about it for a while now and it seems decently reliable at 0.6.3
2014-10-15T00:06:32  <techbytes> didn't moolah aquired mintpal?  moolah is now saying they don't own mintpal...

2014-10-15T00:13:56  <cosbutt> yeah they shut down mintpal now
2014-10-15T00:14:04  <cosbutt> lol, it had like 5btc volume
2014-10-15T00:18:12  <Rickus> what? lol, I swear I saw their scroller say that they had ~900 btc in 24 hr
2014-10-15T00:18:53  <cosbutt> at the very beginning, yeah
2014-10-15T00:19:01  <cosbutt> then volume dropped like a rock
2014-10-15T00:19:12  <cosbutt> last few days volume was ~5
2014-10-15T00:19:27  <RunningmanZ> yeah at the height of Blackcoin's run I think it had like 4k btc volume on Mintpal
2014-10-15T00:19:33  <cosbutt> can't believe they thought taking mintpal meant the volume would follow
2014-10-15T00:19:53  <cosbutt> mintpal worked because it was a quick n easy exchange thrown up to help out whales
2014-10-15T00:21:28  <techbytes> true, once whales migrated to bittrex so went the volume...

2014-10-15T03:35:23  <kenel> that is awesome
2014-10-15T03:38:18  <cosbutt> can it play megaman legends
2014-10-15T03:38:40  <kenel> the idea behind it is that you have a PS4 in one room
2014-10-15T03:38:44  <kenel> and now you want to play in another room
2014-10-15T03:38:55  <kenel> it streams your PS4 from the one room to the other without having to move it
2014-10-15T03:39:04  <kenel> and the control works the same
2014-10-15T03:39:06  <kenel> controler
2014-10-15T03:39:11  <cosbutt> so it can't play megaman legends
2014-10-15T03:39:19  <kenel> isn't that a nintendo thing?
2014-10-15T03:39:21  <cosbutt> it's worthless to me
2014-10-15T03:39:25  <kenel> i think you can d/l that on wii u
2014-10-15T03:39:41  <cosbutt> ah nah legends was an rpg for the psx
2014-10-15T03:39:50  <cosbutt> one of my favorites
2014-10-15T03:40:15  <Trenal> Soon we'll have 10 little boxes to replace the two big ones
2014-10-15T03:41:04  <kenel> it's good for me b/c i keep my ps4 in my garage
2014-10-15T03:41:26  <kenel> but when i have my kids, we can't be out here
2014-10-15T03:41:31  <kenel> it's a man cave with dangerous stuff :\
2014-10-15T03:41:37  <kenel> so i can put it down in my living room
2014-10-15T03:46:14  <kenel> samson_ would you be willing to do a weekly podcast with me?
2014-10-15T03:46:52  <kenel> i mean a weekly dgc related/sponsored/etc podcast for altcoins or just interesting stuff
2014-10-15T03:47:01  <kenel> but mostly dgc :)
2014-10-15T03:47:13  <Dreday00> cool i'll listen
2014-10-15T03:48:07  <kenel> we could call it 'between three coins' or something making fun of 'between two ferns' http://www.funnyordie.com/between_two_ferns but make it a serious podcast, not a galifanakis joke

2014-10-15T03:48:39  <kenel> i'm asking samson_ because he has a total made for radio voice :)
2014-10-15T03:49:19  <kenel> anyway, i'm going to bed, but if you wake up and see this, let me know :)
2014-10-15T03:50:13  <cosbutt> good luck having the material to make weekly podcasts
2014-10-15T03:50:21  <cosbutt> a guy on reddit tried to do bi-weekly news updates but ran out pretty fast

2014-10-15T04:11:17  <cosbutt> heya tt
2014-10-15T04:11:43  <TTsquared> Damn dude, another name?
2014-10-15T04:11:54  <cosbutt> lol swearing now?
2014-10-15T04:12:04  <cosbutt> and yeah i'm on another OS
2014-10-15T04:12:27  <cosbutt> not really sure why cosmon is still logged in
2014-10-15T04:13:18  <TTsquared> I don't know why, but that's really funny
2014-10-15T04:13:19  <cosbutt> oh btw, you offered me some miners, i think i'm alright, if you know anyone else who should get into mining give it to them
2014-10-15T04:13:41  <RunningmanZ> TTsquared:hey
2014-10-15T04:15:46  <TTsquared> Thought you might want to contribute some hash to the foundation pool
2014-10-15T04:16:30  <TTsquared> Little things
2014-10-15T04:16:44  <cosbutt> how much hash do they get?
2014-10-15T04:17:33  <TTsquared> I think like 2 MH/s if they're over clocked like Marshall taught us
2014-10-15T04:18:28  <TTsquared> But they're gridseeds so the do scrypt and sha256
2014-10-15T04:19:01  <cosbutt> ah
2014-10-15T04:19:23  <cosbutt> i'm alright, dad would get pissy about the power draw.. hm
2014-10-15T04:19:33  <cosbutt> nobody i know is terribly interested in crypto
2014-10-15T04:19:50  <TTsquared> that's okay, I have a place for then
2014-10-15T04:20:09  <TTsquared> Just wanted you to know I was thinking about you
2014-10-15T04:20:10  <cosbutt> cool
2014-10-15T04:20:19  <cosbutt> thanks :)
2014-10-15T04:20:31  <cosbutt> i'm always thinking of you TT
2014-10-15T04:20:54  <TTsquared> I hope that's a good thing

2014-10-15T04:21:31  <cosbutt> who's this new pr girl?
2014-10-15T04:22:00  <TTsquared> I saw her on irc before

2014-10-15T04:23:21  <cosbutt> just never seen her around myself
2014-10-15T04:23:27  <cosbutt> it'd be great to get more vocal folk
