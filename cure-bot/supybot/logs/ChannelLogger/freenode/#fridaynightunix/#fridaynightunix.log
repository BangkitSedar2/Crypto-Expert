2014-09-18T21:10:25  <Deacyde> no I linked a db to a registration php members only thing, and understand how to fuck with it, rather than just copy and paste it
2014-09-18T21:11:09  <broketech> did you single quote your vars?
2014-09-18T21:11:35  <Deacyde> I could loook at notes from the smartest man in the world, written for the dumbest man of the world, and still go " whaaaa?!?! " but I try the same shit on my own, and fail a thousand times before I succeed and Boom, it's on like nekkid donkey kong
2014-09-18T21:12:24  <broketech> donkey kong cant save you from an 'or 1' in a password field
2014-09-18T21:12:40  <Deacyde> Yes single quotes are mostly used if not all

2014-09-18T21:41:44  <shakezula> heh
2014-09-18T21:42:09  <shakezula> its so nearly identical to last year, only difference is there's no chinese rescue squad waiting in the wings
2014-09-18T21:42:27  <Deacyde> lol
2014-09-18T21:42:43  <Deacyde> nope, just more manipulation from other groups
2014-09-18T21:42:53  <shakezula> bah
2014-09-18T21:42:57  <Deacyde> its a science now
2014-09-18T21:42:59  <shakezula> the only manipulation is by mining
2014-09-18T21:43:11  <shakezula> produce - turn in to cash - rinse - repeat
2014-09-18T21:43:15  <Deacyde> and trader bots, its a ocean of waves
2014-09-18T21:43:22  <Deacyde> wel that too
2014-09-18T21:43:29  <shakezula> people aren't dumb enough to think "gee if i buy this i'll make a bunch of money" anymore
2014-09-18T21:43:30  <Deacyde> but even the time you cash out matters
2014-09-18T21:43:39  <shakezula> very true
2014-09-18T21:44:22  <Deacyde> it'll change soon though
2014-09-18T21:44:38  <shakezula> how?
2014-09-18T21:45:14  <Deacyde> one of these big players is going to do something to be more appealing to others
2014-09-18T21:45:25  <shakezula> wouldn't it be ironic
2014-09-18T21:45:27  <shakezula> if that was paypal
2014-09-18T21:45:30  <shakezula> hahahaha
2014-09-18T21:46:00  <shakezula> though, i'm sticking to "it has value" but no one is dumb enough to drop a ton of money in to it after seeing the last 9 months of graphs
2014-09-18T21:46:11  <shakezula> even if someone comes along and it suddenly gets popular
2014-09-18T21:46:14  <shakezula> (unlikely)
2014-09-18T21:46:18  <shakezula> it ain't going to $1000 again
2014-09-18T21:46:21  <Deacyde> never know, but what's going to hit home, is a service to rival apple n google pay, or incorporate bitcoin / altcoins into a funneled pay like bitpay / gyft have done
2014-09-18T21:46:25  <shakezula> not even if it gets an ETF
2014-09-18T21:46:40  <shakezula> bro dood bro
2014-09-18T21:46:43  <shakezula> apple pay
2014-09-18T21:46:48  <shakezula> like it or not
2014-09-18T21:46:55  <Deacyde> Bitcoin cant go higher until mass adoption occurs
2014-09-18T21:46:56  <shakezula> WILL be the big thing for the next few years
2014-09-18T21:47:07  <Deacyde> and that cant happen until its more useful than the internet to people
2014-09-18T21:47:08  <shakezula> and it wasn't apple who did it first
2014-09-18T21:47:15  <shakezula> its just apple will get it right
2014-09-18T21:47:17  <Deacyde> people are too dumb to want to use new shit
2014-09-18T21:47:21  <shakezula> and make it painless for gramma to use
2014-09-18T21:47:27  <Deacyde> thats why we have a lack of science and engineer students
2014-09-18T21:47:38  <shakezula> yes we  do
2014-09-18T21:47:44  <Deacyde> cuz its too hard
2014-09-18T21:47:44  <shakezula> yes we surely do
2014-09-18T21:47:53  <Deacyde> and too much other things to do instead of try the hard stuff
2014-09-18T21:47:54  <Deacyde> lol

2014-09-18T21:51:46  <Deacyde> Nope, why would they change it
2014-09-18T21:52:00  <shakezula> they want the whole levant
2014-09-18T21:52:12  <shakezula> because its bigger than "iraq and syria"
2014-09-18T21:52:13  <Deacyde> lol, I'm still not convinced it's all it is
2014-09-18T21:52:27  <Deacyde> Always funny how we end up training / paying for these groups
2014-09-18T21:52:34  <Deacyde> openly too
2014-09-18T21:52:44  <shakezula> the levant is the whole big arse middle-east

2014-09-18T21:53:28  <Deacyde> yeah like the whole fact that we create these groups to further the war machine profit lines?
2014-09-18T21:53:32  <shakezula> let those lands go back to those who they rightfully belong to
2014-09-18T21:53:36  <shakezula> and mind our own business
2014-09-18T21:53:41  <shakezula> bingo, you got it
2014-09-18T21:53:41  <Deacyde> lol, we'd never do that
2014-09-18T21:53:50  <Deacyde> that's how we go broke
2014-09-18T21:53:51  <shakezula> the middle east currently we owe to england and france
2014-09-18T21:54:09  <Deacyde> Middle east is a Biological ATM

2014-09-18T21:54:38  <Deacyde> they wanna fight the winners with who gets what after they handle the threat
2014-09-18T21:55:31  <Deacyde> the enemy of your enemy is your friend until your enemy is dead, then the enemy of your enemy is the guy you just killed to get his U.S. gear and money
2014-09-18T21:55:50  <shakezula> ^
2014-09-18T21:55:54  <Deacyde> doesn't hurt that the guys under him will follow you now either
2014-09-18T21:56:20  <shakezula> just like the mormons wanted utah
2014-09-18T21:56:23  <Deacyde> sad part is, I cannot not see all this coming home, to " control " us wildlings here
2014-09-18T21:56:25  <shakezula> let the muslims have the middle east
2014-09-18T21:56:34  <Deacyde> it's not muslims
2014-09-18T21:56:51  <shakezula> oh im sorry, not muslims, RADICALS right?
2014-09-18T21:56:53  <Deacyde> it's idiots who weren't ever raised right, it's war children doctrines
2014-09-18T21:57:00  <shakezula> radical ideas are bad
2014-09-18T21:57:05  <Deacyde> there is nothing religious about them
2014-09-18T21:57:09  <shakezula> no matter what religion espouses them
2014-09-18T21:57:21  <shakezula> the crusades were the beginning of all of this
2014-09-18T21:57:29  <shakezula> its just taken 1000 years to come full circle
2014-09-18T21:57:42  <Deacyde> possible, but why didn't they get the memo the rest of the world did
2014-09-18T21:57:49  <Deacyde> about us all being human and bleeding red
2014-09-18T21:58:03  <Deacyde> it's a scapegoat to use that concept against the smarter people
2014-09-18T21:58:03  <shakezula> bah, its easy to hide behind religious horseshit
2014-09-18T21:58:10  <shakezula> "leave it up to MY god"
2014-09-18T21:58:24  <Deacyde> its like laws and crime being commited even in line of law
2014-09-18T21:58:26  <shakezula> "MY god said your god sucks, so i gotta kill you"
2014-09-18T21:58:32  <Deacyde> yeap
2014-09-18T21:58:48  <Deacyde> strip away god, and it's just some fuck thinks he gets to have more than others
2014-09-18T21:59:32  <shakezula> its part of why im a non believer
2014-09-18T21:59:43  <shakezula> the whole concept of a benevolent creator
2014-09-18T21:59:45  <Deacyde> God didn't say you get to have all this shit, lol god was mute to every other fucker here, lol, go drink a beer and smoke crack eith rob ford and mormon's joseph
2014-09-18T21:59:45  <shakezula> goes out the window

2014-09-18T22:02:53  <shakezula> FOREVER
2014-09-18T22:02:53  <Deacyde> But!
2014-09-18T22:02:56  <Deacyde> I always think about this
2014-09-18T22:03:10  <Deacyde> what if they rig these miners somehow to mine all coins at once
2014-09-18T22:03:11  <Deacyde> lol
2014-09-18T22:03:15  <shakezula> yea im doing that
2014-09-18T22:03:18  <shakezula> multipool.us
2014-09-18T22:03:20  <Deacyde> what>?
2014-09-18T22:03:22  <Deacyde> no no
2014-09-18T22:03:23  <shakezula> just mine and accumulate
2014-09-18T22:03:25  <Deacyde> EVERYCOIN
2014-09-18T22:03:27  <Deacyde> at once
2014-09-18T22:03:30  <shakezula> oh you mean merge mine everything
2014-09-18T22:03:32  <shakezula> heh
2014-09-18T22:03:33  <Deacyde> yes
2014-09-18T22:03:38  <shakezula> well multipool is doing that with DOGE
2014-09-18T22:03:45  <Deacyde> only with doge / ltc right
2014-09-18T22:03:46  <shakezula> your hashes at multipool get you DOGE the whole time
2014-09-18T22:03:51  <Deacyde> oh nice
2014-09-18T22:03:53  <shakezula> no, DOGE and all the scrypt coins
2014-09-18T22:03:57  <Deacyde> still doge sucks then
2014-09-18T22:04:00  <shakezula> not sure how the hell they are doing that
2014-09-18T22:04:02  <shakezula> but it works
2014-09-18T22:04:09  <shakezula> yea DOGE does suck
2014-09-18T22:04:10  <Deacyde> prolly just giving us their coins
2014-09-18T22:04:10  <Deacyde> lol
2014-09-18T22:04:13  <shakezula> but im kinda partial
2014-09-18T22:04:16  <Deacyde> I am too
2014-09-18T22:04:16  <X3n0X> you can merge mine doge, syscoin, peseta coin, burbu coin, sapphire coin, united scypt coin
2014-09-18T22:04:17  <shakezula> being somewhat involved
2014-09-18T22:04:19  <X3n0X> all at once
2014-09-18T22:04:19  <Deacyde> and I always believe
2014-09-18T22:04:21  <Deacyde> becuase
2014-09-18T22:04:27  <Deacyde> an altcoin WILL replace bitcoin
2014-09-18T22:04:31  <X3n0X> and probably a couple more
2014-09-18T22:04:32  <shakezula> the original DOGE client even had my name in the about box
2014-09-18T22:04:33  <shakezula> lol
2014-09-18T22:04:38  <Deacyde> that whole 10,000 btc for a pizza will happen with another con
2014-09-18T22:04:49  <Deacyde> coin, con same thing
2014-09-18T22:04:51  <Deacyde> j/k
2014-09-18T22:04:57  <Deacyde> I do believe but know humanity too
2014-09-18T22:05:02  <shakezula> freud is chuckling in his grave
2014-09-18T22:05:25  <Deacyde> possible, or wondering why he is still in that dusty old fart of a body
2014-09-18T22:05:53  <shakezula> im down with DOGE +
2014-09-18T22:05:59  <Deacyde> and does all the organisms on an in your Die when you do..
2014-09-18T22:06:06  <shakezula> better than Qubits + or Frankos + or some other shit coin
2014-09-18T22:06:07  <Deacyde> so that should leave you thinking
2014-09-18T22:06:15  <Deacyde> down with OPP
2014-09-18T22:06:17  <Deacyde> lol
2014-09-18T22:06:17  <shakezula> at least DOGEs have a huge market place although they are worthless
2014-09-18T22:06:26  <X3n0X> you guys followed NLG?

2014-09-18T23:33:25  <shakezula> then panic
2014-09-18T23:33:27  <shakezula> and reboot
2014-09-18T23:33:29  <slayersher> lol

2014-09-18T23:35:15  <shakezula> i loved the touchpad on the macbook pros circa 2006-2008
2014-09-18T23:35:20  <broketech> and apm runs full tilt

2014-09-21T08:22:21  <xisi> so heres a question to brighter minds
2014-09-21T08:22:47  <xisi> if auxpow is one of the only reqs to merged mining why not do like 50 coins?
2014-09-21T08:29:45  <Belxjander> xisi: ???
2014-09-21T08:30:16  <xisi> idk, am I wrong?
2014-09-21T08:39:02  *** ladle <ladle!~ladle@andarazoroflove.org> has joined #fridaynightunix
2014-09-21T08:39:02  *** ladle <ladle!~ladle@andarazoroflove.org> has left #fridaynightunix
2014-09-21T08:47:05  <broketech> there are only so many aux coins
2014-09-21T08:47:08  <broketech> i guess
2014-09-21T08:47:52  <broketech> i always figured that major pools merged as much as possible behind the scenes
2014-09-21T08:48:03  <xisi> I mean it doesnt seem unreasonable to me to like
2014-09-21T08:48:14  <xisi> start with the biggest of an algo ie btc and merged mine everything under it
2014-09-21T08:48:29  <broketech> the problem is it is essentially solo mining
2014-09-21T08:48:36  <broketech> per pool basis
2014-09-21T08:48:37  <xisi> besides the redic space/compute requirement
2014-09-21T08:48:50  <broketech> and the diff follow btc up sharply
2014-09-21T08:49:07  <broketech> i ran my p2pool btc node on a dual core laptop
2014-09-21T08:49:10  <xisi> I guess but instead of getting only 1-2 you have up to X possibly
2014-09-21T08:49:19  <xisi> roi for your miners
2014-09-21T08:49:47  <xisi> yeah smaller pool but if it takes off you've got everything under it
2014-09-21T08:49:53  <broketech> right
2014-09-21T08:50:26  <broketech> i havent even looked since the beginning of the years, nmc et al diffs went nutts
2014-09-21T08:50:31  <broketech> year
2014-09-21T08:50:38  <xisi> idk I dont claim to understand the tech behind merged stuff it just seems if lower diff/auxpow is the only req why not
2014-09-21T08:51:01  <broketech> yes
2014-09-21T08:51:07  <broketech> i agree
2014-09-21T08:51:43  <broketech> just picking your setup i guess
2014-09-21T08:51:50  <broketech> p2pool its ready to go
2014-09-21T08:52:00  <xisi> yeah, I mean hosting 500 daemons doesnt sound like fun
2014-09-21T08:52:07  <xisi> but if you can do it and keep them up eh, it might work
2014-09-21T08:52:10  <broketech> its usually like 5 tops
2014-09-21T08:53:00  <broketech> so if you have a bunch of main chain sha coins, and pools (couugh marty at ispace) you can run one set of merge coin wallets to "solo" against
2014-09-21T08:54:00  <broketech> supposedly it will even work if btc isnt the main chain, the trick is getting the multi billion diff that the merge coins require
2014-09-21T08:55:02  <xisi> is it worth my time i guess is the question
2014-09-21T08:55:13  <broketech> all i can say is maybe
2014-09-21T08:55:24  <broketech> when the diff for btc was 525 million
2014-09-21T08:55:31  <broketech> and nmc was 325 mil
2014-09-21T08:56:11  <broketech> i hit a 500 mil diff. only it was the night after a subwoofer caught on fire in my office and my merge node wasnt running :(
2014-09-21T08:56:23  <xisi> :(
2014-09-21T08:57:11  <broketech> but they have blake and scrypt merged now too i think
2014-09-21T08:57:20  <xisi> yeah i know at least scrypt
2014-09-21T08:57:32  <xisi> am i correct in those 2 things being the only real reqs?
2014-09-21T08:57:42  <broketech> i said w/e with the blake and just use one of their pools
2014-09-21T08:57:46  <broketech> yes
2014-09-21T08:57:53  <broketech> at the expense of your sanity
2014-09-21T08:57:56  <xisi> i mean i think its worth it, just a mtter of growing the pool
2014-09-21T08:58:03  <broketech> right
2014-09-21T08:58:05  <broketech> or pools
2014-09-21T08:58:12  <broketech> ;)
2014-09-21T08:58:20  <xisi> or take the idea to an existing pool and build the back end
2014-09-21T08:58:25  <broketech> someone somewhere will hit that diff
2014-09-21T08:58:50  <broketech> if they are smart they already are
2014-09-21T08:59:02  <broketech> and using pps on top of it >.<
2014-09-21T08:59:03  <xisi> well i know a lot of the bigger ones do, i guess just scale being the big issue
2014-09-21T08:59:21  <broketech> slush turned his merge payout off
2014-09-21T08:59:23  <xisi> i dont really see why its a huge pain if youre basically just passing the tries around internally
2014-09-21T08:59:32  <broketech> its not huge
2014-09-21T08:59:38  <broketech> knowing how to set it up
2014-09-21T08:59:44  <xisi> yeah i guess
2014-09-21T08:59:58  <broketech> like i said, p2pool has it native
2014-09-21T09:00:06  <broketech> not sure about everyone else
2014-09-21T09:00:17  <xisi> theres a fork for node, no idea if it works
2014-09-21T09:00:24  <broketech> no idea haha
2014-09-21T09:02:51  <xisi> thank you either way, will figure it out
2014-09-21T09:03:20  <Belxjander> hrmmm
2014-09-21T09:03:20  <Belxjander> well I will be working on some bitcoin code once I have gotten this AmigaOS IME out of the way

2014-09-24T03:21:33  <shakezula> aberdeen is also in washington and scotlan
2014-09-24T03:21:33  <shakezula> d
2014-09-24T03:24:35  <Deacyde> I member the scotland one
2014-09-24T03:24:46  <Deacyde> its all over the place
2014-09-24T03:25:09  <Deacyde> when I was a kid I looked up in a roadmap atlas all the like minded names around me
2014-09-24T03:25:45  <Deacyde> came to the conclusion either very few creative people around to name these places, or people are weird and want to just rename everything the same
2014-09-24T03:26:13  <Deacyde> either or, I think humanity has OCD
2014-09-24T03:26:15  <shakezula> yea i always wondered why there's places that are named the same like that
2014-09-24T03:26:25  <shakezula> portland or and portland me make sense
2014-09-24T03:26:28  <shakezula> as they both have the ocean
2014-09-24T03:26:32  <shakezula> ugh, brb
2014-09-24T03:32:15  <tlp> ah, Aberdeen... Idaho in a nutshell :p
2014-09-24T05:03:40  <Belxjander> that is because there is very little non-selfish creativity within the scope of the english language for naming things without borrowing from another language in the first place
2014-09-24T05:11:56  <broketech> shakezula, the big question: are you getting paid?

2014-09-25T17:40:56  <slayersher> depends on the amps sir shake
2014-09-25T17:40:58  <slayersher> but probably
2014-09-25T17:41:14  <slayersher> i had 4 40 amp breakers for my miner room
2014-09-25T17:41:24  <slayersher> so i could prob do 10ish
2014-09-25T17:42:22  <shakezula> my whole rig here only draws about 800w

2014-09-29T17:05:16  <shakezula> no, i agree with you 100% that diet drinks are evil
2014-09-29T17:05:17  <Deacyde> I remember someone buying us shoes for our daughter when she was little, from overseas, and they smelled like gasoline, and were made of acrylic
2014-09-29T17:05:17  <shakezula> but meh
2014-09-29T17:05:43  <shakezula> hahaha, sounds like the chinese scooter i bought

2014-09-29T17:07:55  <shakezula> yea the handle grips, the seat, the box for putting the helmet in
2014-09-29T17:08:12  <shakezula> all the plastic parts for the first month or two were very off-gassing
2014-09-29T17:09:25  <Deacyde> that's crazy, specially the helmet, was gonna say scooter you can imagine a bit smelling like gas but the helmet and the rest, I bet you checked the gas line a few times

2014-09-30T23:06:49  <Deacyde> After a 15-minute hearing, Facciola ordered Gonzalez held until Oct. 1, pending revocation of bond by authorities in an unrelated July 19 incident in Wythe County, Va. In that case, he was arrested while allegedly carrying a sawed-off shotgun, two sniper rifles and several other firearms, as well as a map of the Washington area with the Masonic Temple in Alexandria, Va., circled and a line pointed toward the White House, a local prosecutor said.

2014-10-01T01:02:32  <shakezula> yea i agree, mining is fun at low prices though

2014-10-01T01:35:34  <Belxjander> broketech: ahh okay...well I don't need any high-end gear for high-speed display purposes...
2014-10-01T01:36:14  <Belxjander> broketech: it sounds like what you want is a single desktop on a desk with a seriously dammed high-end graphics card for displaying the data and a laptop for actual trading commands
2014-10-01T01:37:21  <Belxjander> Hell...if you are only needing active displays then you can get away with a RPi or BBB with a monitor and bracket case for each independent display
2014-10-01T01:37:36  <Belxjander> and using high-end touch-panel monitors
2014-10-01T01:37:42  <Belxjander> so that each is completely independent
2014-10-01T01:38:11  <Belxjander> cheap quick and functional with the right setup installed
2014-10-01T01:39:36  <broketech> yah desktop is actually my gamer, but use it for linux/dev/whatever
2014-10-01T01:39:51  <shakezula> imac
2014-10-01T01:39:51  <broketech> just would be nice to have a dev machine i can bail with, that actually works
2014-10-01T01:39:56  <shakezula> iiiiimac
2014-10-01T01:39:58  <shakezula> you need it
2014-10-01T01:40:02  <Belxjander> broketech: I would break the gaming and linux/dev/brokerage onto seperate machines
2014-10-01T01:40:04  <broketech> what you have an i5?
2014-10-01T01:40:09  <shakezula> i7
2014-10-01T01:40:12  <Belxjander> and run them both as high-end gaming builds
2014-10-01T01:40:33  <broketech> planning on it, have an acer with hd screen, but its a neutered intel chip
2014-10-01T01:40:53  <shakezula> its my only i at home
2014-10-01T01:40:58  <shakezula> i have an i7 at work
2014-10-01T01:40:59  <broketech> not so concerned aobut dev and gamer sharing machine, cant do both at once
2014-10-01T01:41:00  <shakezula> and an i5 work laptop
2014-10-01T01:41:07  <Belxjander> broketech: if you want...I can design you a brokerage rig also good for linux/dev work OR use the same rig for gaming?
2014-10-01T01:41:19  <broketech> continuity of chat is imperitive
2014-10-01T01:41:33  <Belxjander> broketech: so that you can build 2x or 3x the same rig and run the whole thing as a single system
2014-10-01T01:41:38  <shakezula> but at home my other chips are pentium 950, q6600 core2duo; e8500 core2duo
2014-10-01T01:41:41  <shakezula> atom
2014-10-01T01:41:54  <shakezula> got a inspiron mini 10
2014-10-01T01:41:58  <shakezula> that thing is a dog
2014-10-01T01:42:01  <shakezula> sooo slow
2014-10-01T01:42:02  <broketech> plus have another amd desktop waiting in the wings haha
2014-10-01T01:42:15  <broketech> but my kid gets that, has his mc install
2014-10-01T01:42:46  <broketech> not concerned aobut designing it, just getting the time to set everything up and clean my desk
2014-10-01T01:44:20  <Belxjander> broketech: ahh like me...lacking time?
2014-10-01T01:46:06  <broketech> mostly
2014-10-01T01:46:35  <broketech> plus this lts install is past its lts, need to backup, jump ship, consolidate all my data and pics
2014-10-01T01:49:24  <broketech> to sum up: one compaq laptop hackintosh with no apm support, one core2 mac(hi shake) where the battery bubbled, one core2 hp that has been my "work" laptop for the last 6 years, one acer that has always had bad bad, then my kids peeled the keys off the kb, one smaller hp corporate core2, that hangs every ten seconds or so due to probably the mini sata drive sounding like a cement mixer
2014-10-01T01:49:58  <broketech> plus single core ibm, yes ibm thinkpad, pre lenovo that used to be my mining/pool controller
2014-10-01T01:54:01  <broketech> probably should say fuck it and sell the macs to some sucker
2014-10-01T01:55:23  <Deacyde> HASHTAG

2014-10-01T02:04:55  <Deacyde> looking at the trade quantities it's just being pushed down so someone can load up cheap to later on sell when it climbs again
2014-10-01T02:05:02  <Deacyde> like low tide and high tides

2014-10-01T02:48:40  <Deacyde> isnt price competitng as thats closer, this is random with prices and more towards a pattern of price lowering
2014-10-01T02:48:46  <Deacyde> yes
2014-10-01T02:48:47  <slayersher> there pushing the price down for re buys
2014-10-01T02:48:53  <slayersher> yup yup
2014-10-01T02:48:55  <slayersher> you are correct sir
2014-10-01T02:48:57  <Deacyde> but then the price will trapoline up
2014-10-01T02:48:58  <Deacyde> lol
2014-10-01T02:49:03  <slayersher> also the high price was .14
2014-10-01T02:49:10  <Deacyde> had to go place some higher sell orders to ride it
2014-10-01T02:49:10  <slayersher> just an fyi
2014-10-01T02:49:21  <Deacyde> yeah I saw that in history
2014-10-01T02:49:26  <Deacyde> on allcrypt too
2014-10-01T02:49:29  <slayersher> yup
2014-10-01T02:49:53  <Deacyde> patterns are highlighted almost though lol hard to miss
2014-10-01T02:49:53  <slayersher> wait you will see a large buy that will eat it all the way to +0.07
2014-10-01T02:49:57  <slayersher> yah
2014-10-01T02:50:01  <slayersher> its not random enough
2014-10-01T02:50:02  <slayersher> lol
2014-10-01T02:50:05  <slayersher> someones semi new
2014-10-01T02:50:25  <Deacyde> true, its fun to learn from em though
2014-10-01T02:50:31  <Deacyde> has to be a bot though cuz its fast
2014-10-01T02:50:39  <slayersher> yup
2014-10-01T02:50:42  <slayersher> and yup
2014-10-01T02:50:48  <slayersher> 5th on bittrex for volume
2014-10-01T02:50:54  <slayersher> and 21% spread
2014-10-01T02:51:08  <Deacyde> its only on 5 right?
2014-10-01T02:51:13  <slayersher> ?
2014-10-01T02:51:17  <slayersher> for volume ?
2014-10-01T02:51:25  <Deacyde> exchange
2014-10-01T02:51:38  <slayersher> 5 exchanges ? lol
2014-10-01T02:51:47  <slayersher> only 3 i know of
2014-10-01T02:52:03  <Deacyde> allcrypt, bittrx and the no name
2014-10-01T02:52:09  <slayersher> rockytrade
2014-10-01T02:52:17  <Deacyde> then its 4
2014-10-01T02:52:22  <slayersher> hmm
2014-10-01T02:52:37  <Deacyde> https://btc-market.org/?Pair=VIK_BTC
2014-10-01T02:52:39  <dobbscoin> [LTC/BTC] - BTC-Market - Fast, Reliable, and Secure cryptocurrency exchange
2014-10-01T02:54:16  <slayersher> never even seen that exchange lol
2014-10-01T02:54:41  <Deacyde> that's what I mean, scurry
2014-10-01T02:55:34  <Deacyde> when I think of an exchange, I don't think of one run by any one grp, I think of 100% automated and Peer run, how can that function?
2014-10-01T02:55:51  <slayersher> id assume with a set rule book
2014-10-01T02:56:04  <slayersher> thats then locked from everyone
2014-10-01T02:56:51  <slayersher> id ask broke or shake though they might have ( and by might i mean will ) a better idea of what it would take
2014-10-01T02:57:01  <slayersher> but id assume make it sorta like a coin idea
2014-10-01T02:57:04  <slayersher> with a set of rules
2014-10-01T02:57:07  <slayersher> that then just runs
2014-10-01T02:57:12  <slayersher> nothing can be changed
2014-10-01T02:57:45  <slayersher> but its then autonomous
2014-10-01T02:58:56  <Deacyde> ahhh ok
2014-10-01T02:59:22  *** ladle <ladle!~ladle@andarazoroflove.org> has joined #fridaynightunix
2014-10-01T02:59:22  *** ladle <ladle!~ladle@andarazoroflove.org> has left #fridaynightunix
2014-10-01T03:01:13  <slayersher> and just have a coin vote processes built in for new coins etc
2014-10-01T03:01:16  <Deacyde> Wouldnt this guys bot just end up selling all low without convincing anying
2014-10-01T03:01:19  <Deacyde> anyone
2014-10-01T03:01:22  <slayersher> no
2014-10-01T03:01:33  <slayersher> it will push it down into the larger buy walls
2014-10-01T03:01:47  <Deacyde> interesting
2014-10-01T03:01:49  <slayersher> so he sells a few panics kids then they dump into his much larger walls untill there will be a bottom
2014-10-01T03:01:55  <slayersher> ive not looked at the full charts
2014-10-01T03:02:01  <slayersher> but there will be a bottom he put in
2014-10-01T03:02:02  <Deacyde> I mean I need to see a bot work by fiddling with one
2014-10-01T03:02:05  <slayersher> then same idea back up
2014-10-01T03:02:07  <Deacyde> and Id get it better I think
2014-10-01T03:02:19  <slayersher> small buys some tweets some forum posts
2014-10-01T03:02:19  <Deacyde> that's crazy
2014-10-01T03:02:20  <slayersher> and back up
2014-10-01T03:02:32  <slayersher> also do like 10 smallish buy orders back up
2014-10-01T03:02:37  <Deacyde> whoa tweets and forum posts are tied in
2014-10-01T03:02:38  <Deacyde> ?
2014-10-01T03:02:45  <slayersher> since its on the front page other ppl might see it and buy in
2014-10-01T03:02:46  <slayersher> of course
2014-10-01T03:03:07  * Deacyde places a pillow on his lap
2014-10-01T03:03:10  <Deacyde> that's pretty cool
2014-10-01T03:03:29  <slayersher> its all social manipulation
2014-10-01T03:03:37  <Deacyde> yeah its wild
2014-10-01T03:03:39  <slayersher> nothing against viking coin
2014-10-01T03:03:44  <slayersher> but it offers nothing
2014-10-01T03:03:45  <slayersher> at all lol
2014-10-01T03:03:54  <slayersher> its all bullshit and tweets
2014-10-01T03:04:07  <slayersher> it has a small amount of coins so ppl feel it might be valuable
2014-10-01T03:04:15  <slayersher> also the volume on the exchange helps as well
2014-10-01T03:04:23  <slayersher> makes ppl feel like the others must know somthing
2014-10-01T03:04:37  <Deacyde> see, the way you worded that, I was thinking the bot read into tweets and posts
2014-10-01T03:04:38  <slayersher> if ppl are buying it they must know its gonna be worth somthing so i should buy it
2014-10-01T03:04:45  <slayersher> oh no
2014-10-01T03:04:45  <slayersher> lol
2014-10-01T03:04:46  <Deacyde> I was sure of the obvious
2014-10-01T03:04:47  <Deacyde> lol
2014-10-01T03:04:54  <Deacyde> thats textbook altcoin
2014-10-01T03:04:59  <slayersher> if someone wrote a bot that advanced
2014-10-01T03:05:05  <slayersher> they would be in the stock market
2014-10-01T03:05:12  <Deacyde> thats why I got a textual hardon
2014-10-01T03:05:14  <slayersher> and then have more money then anyone else on the planet lol
2014-10-01T03:05:19  <Deacyde> well thats done too

2014-10-01T03:05:59  <slayersher> not advanced enough yet for what you thought lol
2014-10-01T03:06:00  <slayersher> soon though

2014-10-01T03:06:36  <slayersher> the resources for that are not here yet
2014-10-01T03:06:40  <slayersher> we might be able to code it

2014-10-03T21:26:22  <broketech> if it was like 36-72 hours ok fine
2014-10-03T21:26:25  <broketech> three months
2014-10-03T21:26:27  <broketech> no
2014-10-03T21:39:41  <shakezula> yea 3 months is a long burnin
2014-10-03T21:40:44  <broketech> or however long it was
2014-10-03T21:41:52  <broketech> books for btc, is my mission today
2014-10-03T21:42:20  <broketech> er was
2014-10-03T21:42:44  <broketech> got a hard on over a pragmatic series book: 'seven concurrent methods in seven days'
2014-10-03T21:43:01  <shakezula> sounds like a good read
2014-10-03T21:43:12  <shakezula> bitcoin breaking 300 this weekend?
2014-10-03T21:44:07  <broketech> we will see 120 before christmas, then it will spike back up
2014-10-03T21:44:09  <shakezula> glad i put my kids college fund in at $700
2014-10-03T21:44:24  <shakezula> back up to $200
2014-10-03T21:44:31  <broketech> all the retailers jumping on board are loading up sell pressure
2014-10-03T21:44:50  <broketech> wait for the next halving
2014-10-03T21:44:57  <shakezula> in 2016?
2014-10-03T21:45:13  <shakezula> i'd say 1800 coins per day being mined is the real issue
2014-10-03T21:45:19  <broketech> why, is it 12.5 already?
2014-10-03T21:45:41  <shakezula> no
2014-10-03T21:45:45  <shakezula> it doesn'
2014-10-03T21:45:46  <shakezula> t
2014-10-03T21:45:52  <shakezula> halve again until 8/2016
2014-10-03T21:45:55  <shakezula> its at 25 now
2014-10-03T21:46:45  <shakezula> i think it will be dead and buried by then
2014-10-03T21:47:02  <shakezula> but of course that's a horrificly unpopular opinion
2014-10-03T21:47:30  <broketech> its a year and a half ahead of schedule
2014-10-03T21:48:29  <broketech> im gonna pin it on next summer
2014-10-03T21:48:40  <broketech> july
2014-10-03T21:48:45  <broketech> a wednsday
2014-10-03T21:48:53  <broketech> slight chance of rain
2014-10-03T21:48:53  <shakezula> 2:23 PM
2014-10-03T21:49:45  <broketech> your only hope is to completely finish off the ecdsa that under pins the key generation
2014-10-03T21:49:56  <broketech> even then you have to get around the sig calcs
2014-10-03T21:50:37  <broketech> retailers jumping on board man, that will kill the price but not the coin
2014-10-03T21:51:18  <shakezula> perhaps
2014-10-03T21:51:23  <shakezula> but think about it
2014-10-03T21:51:36  <shakezula> is there really impeutus to buy BTC to purchase something?
2014-10-03T21:51:47  <broketech> ive given it thought
2014-10-03T21:51:55  <broketech> people do man
2014-10-03T21:52:09  <shakezula> really aren't the later comers and retailers simply letting people who got in early buy themselves a world of goodies
2014-10-03T21:52:11  <broketech> i get paid in it, by virtue of whatever it is i do
2014-10-03T21:52:18  <shakezula> at the expense of the later comers?
2014-10-03T21:53:10  <broketech> shrug
2014-10-03T21:53:21  <broketech> you can only buy so much
2014-10-03T21:53:25  <shakezula> heh
2014-10-03T21:53:36  <shakezula> as a medium to send money back and forth internationally
2014-10-03T21:53:38  <shakezula> its amazing
2014-10-03T21:53:39  <broketech> and you would have to sell the btc to acquire goodies
2014-10-03T21:53:47  <broketech> thus recirculating
2014-10-03T21:53:49  <shakezula> but as a medium to make purchases, eh, not so much
2014-10-03T21:54:14  <broketech> my new laptop taking the slow boat from illinois says other wise
2014-10-03T21:54:50  <broketech> if the power company took them, i would have paid that instead of >moneypak>paypal
2014-10-03T21:55:13  <shakezula> the power company taking btc is the ultimate recirculation
2014-10-03T21:55:14  <shakezula> heh
2014-10-03T21:55:27  <broketech> it doesnt hurt to be cynical, but dont stop being critical shake
2014-10-03T21:55:30  <broketech> nap time
2014-10-03T21:55:35  <shakezula> critical?
2014-10-03T21:55:37  <shakezula> of you?
2014-10-03T21:55:40  <shakezula> of course not
2014-10-03T21:55:48  <broketech> no as in giving it thought
2014-10-03T21:55:54  <broketech> critical thinking
2014-10-03T21:56:06  <shakezula> hahaha good point
2014-10-03T21:56:08  <broketech> youve made your mind up

2014-10-05T19:15:36  <broketech> people probably leaving btc in herds, can get a bigger slice

2014-10-05T19:51:41  <Deacyde> ebola got to it
2014-10-05T19:54:22  <Deacyde> the wallets aren't always trying to do what you want them to do.
2014-10-05T19:59:07  <broketech> crazyearner, do you still have the physical disk?
2014-10-05T19:59:25  <CrazyEarner> was ssd n tried evrything
2014-10-05T19:59:49  <broketech> were you using it as you were recovering?
2014-10-05T20:00:01  <CrazyEarner> and on another hard drive that has been took into a data centre n even the ssd that the wallet.dat was on was no data to recover
2014-10-05T20:00:08  <CrazyEarner> no was seprate hdd
2014-10-05T20:00:20  <broketech> ssd its gone yah
2014-10-05T20:00:22  <broketech> hmmm
2014-10-05T20:01:40  <broketech> should photorec with the custom sig just once
2014-10-05T20:01:44  <CrazyEarner> ssd that main one was on disc got wiped when linux got installed n it said created partition that i created to install come back to it n bam wped the fucker clean
2014-10-05T20:01:57  <broketech> photorec
2014-10-05T20:02:14  <broketech> make a custom sig for berkely db
2014-10-05T20:02:26  <broketech> some false positives
2014-10-05T20:02:33  <CrazyEarner> and my bck up drive that it was on crupted files couldent even recover shit of click click click goes the disc tried to recover off seciton i know its on wont evn access it
2014-10-05T20:02:33  <broketech> but had good results before
2014-10-05T20:04:47  <Deacyde> just still has to be another means of safeguarding against this issue, an others that the user doesn't need to clikc a box to use or something.
2014-10-05T20:05:23  <Deacyde> Specially since we are just relaying signals, not really even having the coins stay on the disc
2014-10-05T20:08:08  <broketech> backups
2014-10-05T20:08:18  <broketech> is the safeguard
2014-10-05T20:09:27  <Deacyde> I know, but you need to remember to back them up, and even with that, remember to put it somewhere else aside from the drive your using.
2014-10-05T20:10:00  <Deacyde> and then still, you can backup and still have issues, such as that backup gets messed up or something else.
2014-10-05T20:10:47  <CrazyEarner> to late now and 25BTC never to be seen from it lol
2014-10-05T20:10:51  <CrazyEarner> oh wele shit happens
2014-10-05T20:11:38  <Deacyde> Just you don't have to backup fiat, if I forget it in my pants and wash it the bill or coin is there, if it was a check an the paper desolves, the cash is still in my account or the payee's and I can get a new check written, but if I have btc in a wallet or another coin, an I loose it, I'm fucked and no way a currency will take off with that as a result
2014-10-05T20:13:33  <Deacyde> yes it's shitty an avoidable, but we are humans, we fuck up, mainly when we think we aren't going to fuck up. It's how we learn and move forward with confidence of not repeating
2014-10-05T20:18:45  <broketech> telling you, photorec the drive with the custom signatures
2014-10-05T20:18:55  <broketech> even flash
2014-10-05T20:21:46  <broketech> dd3d image it then photorec the image if you have to
2014-10-05T20:22:01  <broketech> if you have been using the drive..... probably not though
2014-10-05T20:23:11  <Deacyde> would it take up any less filesize to store drive images as pictures and not whole drives?

2014-10-14T05:04:20  <phark> ill take $100 each
2014-10-14T05:04:22  <phark> hehe
2014-10-14T05:04:32  <shakezula> i've seen them around $75-100 on ebay recently
2014-10-14T05:04:53  <shakezula> i offered a guy with BIN at $80, $40
2014-10-14T05:04:55  <shakezula> but he said no
2014-10-14T05:05:18  <shakezula> if you still have them when they are in the $50 range im in
2014-10-14T05:05:20  <shakezula> lol
2014-10-14T05:05:23  <phark> haha
2014-10-14T05:05:38  <phark> its really too bad they cant be repurposed to another algo
2014-10-14T05:05:57  <shakezula> all you have to do
2014-10-14T05:05:59  <shakezula> is make sha coins
2014-10-14T05:06:07  <shakezula> that dont change diff for 20K or more blocks
2014-10-14T05:06:20  <shakezula> morons buying that shit from me at 1000 satoshi
2014-10-14T05:06:21  <phark> crown seems to be slowly changing
2014-10-14T05:06:26  <phark> i know
2014-10-14T05:06:27  <phark> haha
2014-10-14T05:06:31  <phark> dumpfest
2014-10-14T05:06:35  <shakezula> shit yea
2014-10-14T05:06:40  <phark> i had orders up to 1500 all sold
2014-10-14T05:06:45  <shakezula> me too
2014-10-14T05:06:52  <shakezula> a bunch in 1300
2014-10-14T05:07:03  <shakezula> like durp, im no good at this ever but hey
2014-10-14T05:07:11  <phark> too bad mintcoin is worthless .. i have a shitload
2014-10-14T05:07:14  <shakezula> the guy who got 50k from me at 500 is happy
2014-10-14T05:07:50  <shakezula> then again he's probably dumb, will hold it and watch it pull a shibe
2014-10-14T05:08:30  <shakezula> sorry, but if i can turn a .5 profit on 72 hours of mining, i'd call that pretty stupendous at this stage in the game
2014-10-14T05:08:41  <phark> i need to venture into PoS territory
2014-10-14T05:08:51  * shakezula knows the trick now to make them not fork
2014-10-14T05:08:53  <phark> yah it happens rarely
2014-10-14T05:08:55  <phark> enjoy it
2014-10-14T05:09:04  <phark> :)
2014-10-14T05:09:24  <shakezula> took some testing to sort
2014-10-14T05:09:32  <shakezula> still though, they are easy to break
2014-10-14T05:09:57  <phark> need to figure out the aux pow for duo too
2014-10-14T05:10:03  <shakezula> yea and un
2014-10-14T05:10:06  <phark> merge with un
2014-10-14T05:10:09  <shakezula> we need to merge it
2014-10-14T05:10:24  <shakezula> that needs a special pool i believe
2014-10-14T05:10:35  <phark> had a few Un.. dumped @ almost ltc territory
2014-10-14T05:10:52  <phark> been working on custom pool in my spare time
2014-10-14T05:10:52  <shakezula> i still have 20 or so
2014-10-14T05:11:00  <shakezula> i did too, dumped a bunch at .009
2014-10-14T05:11:07  <phark> which has been rather lacking
2014-10-14T05:11:08  <shakezula> and by bunch i mean 15
2014-10-14T05:11:16  <phark> thats quite a few Un
2014-10-14T05:11:26  <shakezula> its quite a few to mine, thats for sure
2014-10-14T05:11:42  <phark> throw the aux pow on all the previous fnu coins
2014-10-14T05:11:49  <phark> dont think its all that complicated
2014-10-14T05:11:51  <shakezula> people are the right kind of obsessed with Un
2014-10-14T05:12:03  <shakezula> although they are all amateur crypto sleuths
2014-10-14T05:12:13  <shakezula> they've built a pretty healthy community
2014-10-14T05:12:20  <shakezula> Un is suprisingly successful
2014-10-14T05:14:04  <phark> that you @ 665
2014-10-14T05:14:18  <phark> you dare undercut my 666 order?
2014-10-14T05:14:22  <shakezula> nope
2014-10-14T05:14:28  <shakezula> mine are at 1200
2014-10-14T05:14:53  <shakezula> no, at 1250
2014-10-14T05:14:58  <shakezula> that's my 5000 coin wall
2014-10-14T05:15:01  <shakezula> WALL
2014-10-14T05:15:14  <shakezula> its a bot, with those fake ass numbers
2014-10-14T05:15:16  <shakezula> has to be
2014-10-14T05:15:33  <shakezula> the coin is round numbers on nearly every other order
2014-10-14T05:18:07  <phark> almost need a bot these days
