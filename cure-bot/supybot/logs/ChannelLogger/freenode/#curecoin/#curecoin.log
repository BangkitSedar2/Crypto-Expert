2014-09-21T19:40:17  <Cygnus-XI> Any pool operators for curecoin please do a fresh git clone and rebuild with the few minor changes. Its not extremely high priority bit when you have the time please do.
2014-09-21T19:42:04  <Cygnus-XI> I'm working on curecoin 1.4 right now, it will have a lot of improvements. Might take a couple days to finish and test though.
2014-09-21T19:42:54  <Cygnus-XI> If anyone needs to speak to me ping me with my name in the channel so I get an alert

2014-09-22T23:09:47  <Cygnus-XI> Haven't heard from ccgirl since her last irc post. Today is her fathers birth date and he is the man this project is dedicated to. Anyone who believes in curecoin needs to be wishing her mom the best. For now don't ping her I don't think she wants to be bothered. I'm anxiously awaiting some good news. I hope we get an update soon. Tonight we will celebrate

2014-09-23T00:22:28  <LasersHurt> Cygnus-XI can give you more details, as he's the developer and much more closely familiar with CCGirl's family, but the short version is that both of them have lost family members to the types of diseases that Folding hopes to cure or find treatments for. Her father passed some time ago, and her mother was very unwell. She's having a Liver transplant today.
2014-09-23T00:23:05  <Josve05a> I wish her the best!
2014-09-23T00:23:12  <LasersHurt> So CC was developed, in part, in her father's memory. Also, of course, for the general good it can do and the technical premise of a coin backed by research.

2014-09-23T00:31:59  <Cygnus-XI> Yes, her dad was lost to pancreatic cancer. When I was working on the original code she was in a phase of listening to his favorite music a lot. This always makes her sad. I hoped to cheer her up and said from now on this is all dedicated to your father. He was a great man and deserves to have his name go down in history. I believe me and him would have been
2014-09-23T00:31:59  <Cygnus-XI> like best friends, he had a mathematical brain. VERY smart guy. This project is a tribute to his memory. I only have seen pictures of him and heard stories.

2014-09-23T18:23:02  <Josve05a> What is the "general" amount of curecoin everybody folding is earning per day?
2014-09-23T18:26:56  *** nilz is now known as nilz^off
2014-09-23T18:29:32  <LasersHurt> For the whole pool of folders?
2014-09-23T18:31:18  <Josve05a> no, per person (on average)
2014-09-23T18:32:12  <LasersHurt> That's a little hard to estimate, as it's based on how many PPD (points per day) the user produces. That depends on what hardware they're folding with. I can give you an example, though
2014-09-23T18:32:18  <Aractor-Work1> That would entirely depend on how many systems they have folding for them, and the power of those systems
2014-09-23T18:32:25  *** Aractor-Work1 is now known as Aractor-Work
2014-09-23T18:33:10  <LasersHurt> Let's say you make 100,000 points. The team, as a whole, does 55,000,000 points. You'd get 55,000,000 / 100,000 * 7488
2014-09-23T18:33:38  <LasersHurt> Woops reverse the first two
2014-09-23T18:33:54  <LasersHurt> 100,000 / 55,000,000 * 7488 = 13.6 CC
2014-09-23T18:34:35  <Josve05a> Ah, thanks!
2014-09-23T18:35:03  <LasersHurt> Yep. The key is the 7488 coins per day issued to folders, and the team's total.
2014-09-23T18:35:26  <Josve05a> (I don't do anywhere near that amount. I use nacl :P )
2014-09-23T18:37:57  <Josve05a> I earn around 0.5 CC /d
2014-09-23T18:40:53  <LasersHurt> Every bit helps, though.
2014-09-23T18:41:17  <LasersHurt> Looks like stats are down right now on Stanford's end, just in case anyone klooks and sees that
2014-09-23T18:41:19  <LasersHurt> looks*
2014-09-23T18:42:08  <Josve05a> I could use my other PC and run the program. But most WU takes  days and the nacl takes ~8 hours on that one...
2014-09-23T18:42:16  <Josve05a> 6 days*
2014-09-23T18:42:38  <LasersHurt> Yeah NACL is very nice for small, easily managed WUs

2014-09-24T13:55:18  <moarrr> Hello all
2014-09-24T13:56:03  <moarrr> I would just like to say, that there may be inaccurate information being spread right now about me, and I would just like to ask for your patience and understanding. There is not a reason to panic and assume the worst, when misunderstandings are often easy to clear up if all parties give others good faith.
2014-09-24T13:56:46  <moarrr> If anyone wants to ask me anything, I am happy if you email me or just pm me, and we can clear it up like reasonable, intellectual gentlemen in the spirit of open source software and cooperation. Thanks. :)

2014-09-25T06:23:36  <Cygnus-XI> good night crypto world, see you in the morning
2014-09-25T06:25:08  <moarrr> i just got a titan bitcoin in the mail yesterday
2014-09-25T06:25:15  <moarrr> its got a qr code
2014-09-25T06:25:30  <moarrr> made of .999 fine copper (it says)
2014-09-25T06:26:41  * moarrr wonders if his phone can use the QR code on the front and fund it
2014-09-25T06:27:55  <moarrr> i really want different physical altcoins too, like cooper, silver, etc
2014-09-25T06:31:24  <Cygnus-XI> oh, someone is awake other then me. Curecoin has another good article incoming ;) should be up in about 2 days, I'll post it as soon as its up
2014-09-25T06:32:37  <moarrr> https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=768417059866215&set=a.199734086734518.44877.100000937842586&type=1 :)
2014-09-25T06:32:50  <moarrr> Cygnus-XI: I can tweet the article if you want
2014-09-25T06:33:06  <Cygnus-XI> so many good things in the works... I almost sold a few curecoins the other day then realized Id be a fool to do so
2014-09-25T06:33:23  <moarrr> theres a few crypto-geeks following me :)
2014-09-25T06:34:19  <Curecoingirl> im not a geek moarrr LMAO
2014-09-25T06:34:23  <Cygnus-XI> That would be great, the alt coin site said they will send it to me for review before its published since our coin is a little complicated compared to some, and many articles have the details messed up
2014-09-25T06:34:38  <moarrr> Cygnus-XI: ok, send me the url whenever u want me to do it

2014-09-25T06:43:32  <Cygnus-XI> I too buried in my curecoin world to notice much of anything else these days

2014-09-25T06:46:13  <moarrr> Cygnus-XI: i want to modify it to put it on a coin, i think i ordered a dogecoin one too
2014-09-25T06:46:23  <moarrr> i want to modify it to put on a necklace*
2014-09-25T06:47:00  <moarrr> im not sure if its an official titan, or resold or a replica
2014-09-25T06:47:03  <moarrr> but i like the design
2014-09-25T06:47:17  <Cygnus-XI> team meetings went great today, proud of my team, they are awesome
2014-09-25T06:47:23  <moarrr> the last bitcoin pendant i tried to make at the jewellers got royally effed so I scrapped it (lost alot of money)
2014-09-25T06:47:37  <moarrr> (and time)
2014-09-25T06:48:02  <moarrr> i wouldnt mind a curecoin one but alot of altcoins dont seem to have physical coins
2014-09-25T06:48:08  <Cygnus-XI> Couldn't ask for a better group to be backing curecoin.  That would be a sweet necklace
2014-09-25T06:48:23  <moarrr> i might buy a casascius coin, those seem to be hugely popular
2014-09-25T06:48:34  <moarrr> these two were pretty cheap lol
2014-09-25T06:48:46  <Cygnus-XI> In time, we know plenty of people with 3d printers that can print metals, only a matter of time
2014-09-25T06:49:06  <moarrr> oh, a friend in -otc showed me a site for someone who does 3d printing in gold
2014-09-25T06:49:07  <moarrr> it was amazing
2014-09-25T06:49:37  <moarrr> http://3dgoldprinting.com/
2014-09-25T06:49:46  <moarrr> im sure shapeways can do soem 3d printing in like certain metals
2014-09-25T06:49:52  <moarrr> not sure if they do gold or something that looks like gold
2014-09-25T06:50:45  <moarrr> im sure you can do plastics, most metals (and ceramics right now)
2014-09-25T06:51:42  <Curecoingirl> https://www.facebook.com/elena.greer1?fref=ts   this girl makes her own 3d printers
2014-09-25T06:51:51  <Cygnus-XI> we could do gold too, low melting point. The amount of contacts some of my team members has is crazy. Already have 3d rendered coin files too. If you really want one talk to the ghostbuster, he just went offline though
2014-09-25T06:52:08  * moarrr loves reprap and the maker community
2014-09-25T06:52:14  <moarrr> i used to read the reddit for 3d printing
2014-09-25T06:52:33  <Curecoingirl> thats cool
2014-09-25T06:53:49  <moarrr> to me its simpler and easier to use shapeways
2014-09-25T06:53:51  <moarrr> lol, 3d printers are expensive
2014-09-25T06:54:05  <Curecoingirl> not really these days
2014-09-25T06:54:07  <moarrr> but i got my little 'inversion of 225 octohedra' that i wear in my photoshoots made from shapeways
2014-09-25T06:54:09  <moarrr> their quick and cheap
2014-09-25T06:54:12  <Curecoingirl> getting cheaper
2014-09-25T06:54:18  <moarrr> well, the cheap 3d printers arent as good as the top ones :)
2014-09-25T06:54:25  <Curecoingirl> right
2014-09-25T06:54:27  <moarrr> i suppose you can get or build a cheap one for 200-300 dollars
2014-09-25T06:54:51  <moarrr> but i usually just wanna make a small number of objects, to a high qualiy, so makes more sense to outsource it to a company
2014-09-25T06:55:14  * moarrr is into fashion and wants to bring 3d printing into it
2014-09-25T06:55:14  <Curecoingirl> true
2014-09-25T06:55:21  <Curecoingirl> sweeeeeet
2014-09-25T06:56:31  * Cygnus-XI dares moarr to be the first to have a gold curecoin printed -- its only a message away when GB is online.
2014-09-25T06:56:43  <moarrr> http://media.postdesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/3d-printing-bikini1.jpg lol
2014-09-25T06:56:52  <moarrr> hehe
2014-09-25T06:56:55  <Curecoingirl> i wanna 3d print a million buddha statues
2014-09-25T06:56:59  <moarrr> id probably do it in a cheaper metal
2014-09-25T06:57:13  <moarrr> but id do curecoin, einsteinium, motocoin, dogecoin maybe
2014-09-25T06:57:13  <Curecoingirl> obsesssed with buddha staues
2014-09-25T06:57:24  <Curecoingirl> statues
2014-09-25T06:57:41  <moarrr> i wanna 3d print a million 3d printers
2014-09-25T06:57:42  <moarrr> j/k :P
2014-09-25T06:57:47  <Curecoingirl> LMao
2014-09-25T07:00:37  <Cygnus-XI> can u fit any more buddha statues in your house? Where will your dog sleep lol
2014-09-25T07:00:50  <Curecoingirl> always room
2014-09-25T07:01:59  <Cygnus-XI> moarr that is actually not a bad idea...
2014-09-25T07:02:13  <moarrr> Cygnus-XI: lol,  are you sure ;/
2014-09-25T07:02:19  <moarrr> Cygnus-XI: reprap can already print a bunch of its own parts
2014-09-25T07:03:02  * moarrr wonders if this will lead to a problem
2014-09-25T07:03:08  <Curecoingirl> lol
2014-09-25T07:03:10  <Cygnus-XI> you could give them out like candy to parts of the world that need things privileged countries dont have
2014-09-25T07:03:41  <moarrr> id be careful, everything can be abused
2014-09-25T07:04:00  <Cygnus-XI> er... unprivileged, came out backswards
2014-09-25T07:05:27  <Cygnus-XI> true, but humans already do that anyways, we all make our own choices.
2014-09-25T07:05:39  <moarrr> indeed
2014-09-25T07:05:48  <moarrr> i think having a good way to recycle 3d printed objects back into raw materials would be a great thing too
2014-09-25T07:06:02  <moarrr> i wanna get some research and discussion started in this area
2014-09-25T07:06:25  * Curecoingirl sleeeppppyyyyy
2014-09-25T07:06:32  <Cygnus-XI> recycling in general needs to be a bigger focus everywhere
2014-09-25T07:07:15  <moarrr> recycling is too difficult sometimes, i think we need better ways to organise information
2014-09-25T07:07:22  <moarrr> ie, an stl file will tell you how something is made
2014-09-25T07:07:27  <moarrr> so it can also tell you how best to recycle it
2014-09-25T07:07:35  <moarrr> the current manufacturing system may simply be flawed
2014-09-25T07:07:54  <Cygnus-XI> I love how Chicago has solar powered recycling machines on street corners instead of trash cans
2014-09-25T07:07:54  <moarrr> also, you could in theory hash an STL file, and pring a qr code on the object, kinda like a checksum to prevent abuse
2014-09-25T07:08:28  <moarrr> Cygnus-XI: has it? ive never seen em lol
2014-09-25T07:08:58  <moarrr> london doesnt seems to be boring (or maybe everythings hidden from me)
2014-09-25T07:09:12  <moarrr> london doesnt, seems to be boring*
2014-09-25T07:10:02  <Cygnus-XI> yea, they have one side that is for non recycleable trash, and another for plastic, cardboard, etc..
2014-09-25T07:10:29  <moarrr> have you seen some of the amazing things some people are doing with magnets
2014-09-25T07:10:38  <moarrr> i wonder if you cuold 3d print magnetic stuff, and automate teh recycling with clever mechanics
2014-09-25T07:10:38  <Cygnus-XI> the non recycled stuff gets compacted by the solar power too
2014-09-25T07:11:28  <moarrr> reddit.com/r/futurology
2014-09-25T07:11:32  <moarrr> has some amazing ideas there
2014-09-25T07:11:32  <Cygnus-XI> im sure that would be doable
2014-09-25T07:11:39  <moarrr> i used to spend all day there
2014-09-25T07:12:28  <moarrr> oh and reddit.com/Rad_Decentralization is cool too
2014-09-25T07:12:33  <moarrr> oh and reddit.com/r/Rad_Decentralization is cool too
2014-09-25T07:12:54  <Cygnus-XI> integrate lasers to help identify further the material, magnets, you could make a really nice auto recycle machine
2014-09-25T07:13:03  <moarrr> indeed
2014-09-25T07:13:21  <moarrr> i think if you save peopel tiem and labor, they would probably be able to help themselves better
2014-09-25T07:13:40  <moarrr> RFID could work too
2014-09-25T07:13:45  <moarrr> if you could print tiny RFID tags into things
2014-09-25T07:13:51  <moarrr> simpler than lasers possbily
2014-09-25T07:14:17  <moarrr> multimaterial 3d printers will be awesome once their affordable
2014-09-25T07:14:20  <moarrr> and developed
2014-09-25T07:14:29  * moarrr wants to buy some Stratasys or 3D systems stock so badly lol
2014-09-25T07:14:36  <Cygnus-XI> indeed ( i twist my non existent curly mustache ends when is say that)
2014-09-25T07:14:42  <moarrr> lol
2014-09-25T07:16:20  <Cygnus-XI> actually i really do that, on google hangouts you can give yourself a curly mustache
2014-09-25T07:16:28  <moarrr> hehe
2014-09-25T07:16:40  <Cygnus-XI> and i put it on to say "indeed" in a serious tone
2014-09-25T07:16:54  * moarrr wonders what Cygnus-XI looks like
2014-09-25T07:17:13  * moarrr would like to design his clothes, or maybe a crypto-clothing line or something
2014-09-25T07:17:21  * moarrr isnt sure lol
2014-09-25T07:17:29  <Cygnus-XI> http://curecoin.net/index.php/en/inside-curecoin/the-team
2014-09-25T07:17:30  <moarrr> i like to change the appearance of stuff lol
2014-09-25T07:17:59  <moarrr> wow
2014-09-25T07:18:05  <moarrr> lasershunt looks pretty smart
2014-09-25T07:18:17  <moarrr> you look like a funky engineer Cygnus-XI
2014-09-25T07:18:27  <moarrr> vorkshold looks like a young gamer
2014-09-25T07:18:35  <Cygnus-XI> lol
2014-09-25T07:18:36  <moarrr> carp just looks normal
2014-09-25T07:18:51  <moarrr> the ghostbusters look like a bunch of dodgy burglers
2014-09-25T07:18:51  <moarrr> j/k
2014-09-25T07:19:30  <Cygnus-XI> I wanted to go for a high tech look for release of curecoin, it spikes into a nice mohawk too, but there its combed over
2014-09-25T07:20:08  <Cygnus-XI> cyber punk look is what I was aiming for
2014-09-25T07:20:14  <moarrr> the einsteinium foundation people - cant remember hte last time i saw them
2014-09-25T07:20:36  <moarrr> seems like the curecoin team have their stuff together a bit more than us guys ;)
2014-09-25T07:21:55  <Cygnus-XI> Me and the guy who runs emc2 were trying to brainstorm a  way to work together, but my plate is so full already
2014-09-25T07:22:11  <moarrr> i donno whos doing what in emc2
2014-09-25T07:22:16  <moarrr> probably a bad idea to talk too mucha bout it right now
2014-09-25T07:22:26  <moarrr> but there seems tobe a shift in power and leadership right now
2014-09-25T07:22:49  <moarrr> i might trade a little bit of emc2 for curecoin but im not really that exposed to either market atm anyway
2014-09-25T07:22:57  <moarrr> so doubt it will make much difference
2014-09-25T07:24:11  <Cygnus-XI> well, at least you are out supporting good causes
2014-09-25T07:24:22  <moarrr> lol
2014-09-25T07:24:34  <moarrr> not sure about that sometimes, i try, but sometimes the things i support just dont work
2014-09-25T07:24:49  <Cygnus-XI> all one can do is try
2014-09-25T07:25:00  <moarrr> i like to be creative and intelligent these days
2014-09-25T07:25:05  <moarrr> skip over the problems :)
2014-09-25T07:25:20  <moarrr> thats why i dont really trade any more
2014-09-25T07:25:37  <Cygnus-XI> nothing in life is a guarantee, just gotta keep trying if you believe in something
2014-09-25T07:25:57  <moarrr> i think my social media/marketing/fashion stuff gives me more happyness anyway
2014-09-25T07:26:03  <moarrr> im happy to trust other people to take care of stuff for me
2014-09-25T07:26:20  <moarrr> (well, as long as i dont put all my eggs/trust in one basket)
2014-09-25T07:26:32  <Cygnus-XI> there is a saying about failing a million times is ok if you succeed once
2014-09-25T07:26:53  <moarrr> :)
2014-09-25T07:27:14  <moarrr> depends what your trying to succeed in
2014-09-25T07:27:18  <Cygnus-XI> or it takes a million failures to succeed... i think there are many spins on the phrase, even forbes made their own spin on it
2014-09-25T07:27:28  <moarrr> most of my successes have just made me realise how little i understand about everything
2014-09-25T07:27:38  <moarrr> i wonder if they were even successess sometimes
2014-09-25T07:27:56  <moarrr> i think when i was 18 i liked my life because i had hope, and everything was unknown
2014-09-25T07:28:11  <moarrr> while you may gain one othing or another, you just realise 20 things you didnt see before
2014-09-25T07:28:31  <Cygnus-XI> hrm, feel like you are reading a part of my mind....
2014-09-25T07:28:41  <moarrr> hehe maybe we just share simular experiences Cygnus-XI lol
2014-09-25T07:29:50  <Cygnus-XI> one of my favorites " looking for the answers, to the questions you have found"
2014-09-25T07:29:57  <moarrr> hehe indeed
2014-09-25T07:30:05  <moarrr> I wanna tweet that, it sounds good :)
2014-09-25T07:30:09  <moarrr> can i'z? :)
2014-09-25T07:30:39  <Cygnus-XI> its a Rush lyric, might want to put a  - Rush under it
2014-09-25T07:30:51  <moarrr> yeh dont wanna take someone elses idea or quote
2014-09-25T07:31:37  <Cygnus-XI> its fine as long as you add the - nameofsource
2014-09-25T07:31:44  <moarrr> https://twitter.com/DanMAbraham - posted
2014-09-25T07:32:35  <Cygnus-XI> I had no choice but to retweet that one
2014-09-25T07:32:48  <moarrr> hehe
2014-09-25T07:34:21  <Cygnus-XI> Its gonna be hard to sleep tonight... curecoin meetings went so well
2014-09-25T07:34:44  <Cygnus-XI> I just want to keep working on it
2014-09-25T07:35:03  <moarrr> its 7.35 here in the uk
2014-09-25T07:36:06  <Cygnus-XI> 235 am here in EST of USA
2014-09-25T07:37:45  <Cygnus-XI> haha, one day I got an email from a news writer in the UK, saying can you make a call to me before 10 UK time. I looked up the time conversion and realized I had less then three hours to make the call before they left for vacation
2014-09-25T07:38:18  <moarrr> wow
2014-09-25T07:38:32  <moarrr> i didnt know curecoin was that popular in mainstream media
2014-09-25T07:38:43  <moarrr> market caop seems to be 30k USD
2014-09-25T07:38:46  <moarrr> altho not sure if i trust that number
2014-09-25T07:38:48  <moarrr> not sure how many users there are
2014-09-25T07:38:56  <moarrr> im guessing the value of curecoin is probably very difficult to tell
2014-09-25T07:39:19  <moarrr> market cap*
2014-09-25T07:39:25  <Cygnus-XI> http://coinwik.org/Curecoin there is a list of the accurate articles here
2014-09-25T07:39:39  <Cygnus-XI> well, mostly accurate..
2014-09-25T07:40:03  <Cygnus-XI> there were some that were way off base, never got listed
2014-09-25T07:40:18  <moarrr> ohh didnt know you had a reddit
2014-09-25T07:40:23  <Cygnus-XI> one said that curecoin was owned by cointerra... :/
2014-09-25T07:40:28  <moarrr> i think im stil an admin on einsteinium's subreddit but i think its been dead for a long time
2014-09-25T07:41:02  * moarrr likes on facebook and will sub on reddit
2014-09-25T07:42:24  <moarrr> funny how ive been talkign about and attached to curecoin all this tiem without really knowing that much of all the details
2014-09-25T07:42:50  <Cygnus-XI> You should see all the other folding teams pages responses to curecoin launch, at first they though we figured out how to fold with asics lmao
2014-09-25T07:42:52  <moarrr> i put it down to freenode and the cool people around me i guess :)
2014-09-25T07:43:07  <moarrr> haha
2014-09-25T07:43:17  <moarrr> i think using asics to fold is a bad idea
2014-09-25T07:43:22  <moarrr> they cant be reprogrammed easily
2014-09-25T07:43:25  <moarrr> gpus/fpga's sound better
2014-09-25T07:43:49  <Cygnus-XI> its impossible... fpgas would be they only way to go
2014-09-25T07:43:57  <moarrr> well, cant you do floating point math on asics?
2014-09-25T07:44:27  <moarrr> i thought the problem was with the costs of design and manufacture and the inflexibility of changing it later on
2014-09-25T07:44:54  <moarrr> i think all these bitcoin asic miners are flawed, because someone could just change sha256 to another algo and everyone loses all tehir money
2014-09-25T07:45:01  <Cygnus-XI> each work unit for a protein is different, so you would have to rebuilod the asic for each work unti
2014-09-25T07:45:07  <moarrr> ah right
2014-09-25T07:46:38  <Cygnus-XI> its been discussed a lot, a folding asic would really just be a gpu on steroids
2014-09-25T07:46:45  <moarrr> yeh, i agree
2014-09-25T07:46:51  <moarrr> or maybe come up with a genius algorithm to fold proteins
2014-09-25T07:46:58  <moarrr> i think gpus/fpga's are the best idea for now
2014-09-25T07:47:56  <Cygnus-XI> yea, asics are essentially useless once the algo is abandoned.
2014-09-25T07:48:01  <moarrr> indeed
2014-09-25T07:48:06  <moarrr> thats the flaw i see in bitcoin
2014-09-25T07:48:16  <moarrr> its simply too large and unplanned
2014-09-25T07:48:23  <moarrr> alot of people could lose money and resources very suddenly
2014-09-25T07:48:27  <moarrr> all those asics could become trash in 1 second
2014-09-25T07:48:40  <Cygnus-XI> yep
2014-09-25T07:48:41  <moarrr> diversifying into altcoins only makes sense
2014-09-25T07:48:47  <moarrr> but some people just focus on profit
2014-09-25T07:48:51  <moarrr> very short term profit
2014-09-25T07:49:05  <moarrr> even ECDSA could be broken
2014-09-25T07:49:06  <moarrr> maybe
2014-09-25T07:49:08  <moarrr> unlikely but maybe
2014-09-25T07:49:18  <moarrr> maybe we should create alts with different signature algorithms
2014-09-25T07:49:39  <moarrr> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unbalanced_Oil_and_Vinegar
2014-09-25T07:49:57  <Cygnus-XI> Thats what curecoin 2.0 will be, quantum computing resistant
2014-09-25T07:50:01  <moarrr> cool :)
2014-09-25T07:50:08  <moarrr> ill be there to buy some in that case lol
2014-09-25T07:50:21  <Cygnus-XI> its already in the works, being built from the ground up
2014-09-25T07:51:44  <Cygnus-XI> Its on our site somewhere, and on Vorksholks blog
2014-09-25T07:51:52  * moarrr is excited lol
2014-09-25T07:51:57  <moarrr> to me this is years of my life
2014-09-25T07:52:04  <moarrr> ive been hanging around debating this stuff for a long time
2014-09-25T07:52:31  <moarrr> i bought some XCurrency recently
2014-09-25T07:52:37  <moarrr> its a new anonymous flavor of the month currency lol
2014-09-25T07:52:52  <moarrr> (there must be at least 30 or 40 anon currencies by now, they keep pumping them out)
2014-09-25T07:53:48  <Cygnus-XI> ha, I heard one of the new ANNs said," new anon coin, this time its really anonymous, really!"
2014-09-25T07:53:56  <moarrr> lmao
2014-09-25T07:54:45  <moarrr> im pretty sure if i spent all day finding, analysying, buying and shorting anon currencies, id be rich by now
2014-09-25T07:55:01  <moarrr> to be honist tho, id rather do fashion design or some marketing stuff
2014-09-25T07:55:08  <Cygnus-XI> I think people are just not using BTC or Cure or any other coin right if they cant figure out how to be anonymous...
2014-09-25T07:55:11  <moarrr> get to use my creativity
2014-09-25T07:55:26  <moarrr> i think anonymity is overrated
2014-09-25T07:55:41  <moarrr> people might think they want it, but i think, most of my transactions im happy to leave public
2014-09-25T07:55:48  <moarrr> maybe i like to have my privacy like 1% of the time
2014-09-25T07:55:53  <moarrr> so i can just sit in a coffee shop in peace
2014-09-25T07:56:06  <moarrr> im not sure society would want everyone to be too anonymous
2014-09-25T07:56:21  <moarrr> might just make people think they can get away with anything
2014-09-25T07:56:29  <Cygnus-XI> yea, doing something like that does sound fun. Id like to be designing alternative energy machines of all types, right down to earth batteries
2014-09-25T07:56:52  <moarrr> i own alot of motocoin
2014-09-25T07:57:01  <moarrr> but im not sure if my initial idea for buying it was flawed
2014-09-25T07:57:11  <moarrr> i kinda thought that proof-of-play currencies could be kinda like a global welfare system
2014-09-25T07:57:22  <moarrr> but then people suggest to me that im trying to create a matrix-esque simulation to trap everyone
2014-09-25T07:57:26  <moarrr> so now im doubting myself
2014-09-25T07:57:36  <moarrr> good ideas can have unintended consequences
2014-09-25T07:57:43  <moarrr> and turn out to be bad ideas
2014-09-25T07:58:16  <moarrr> i think maybe just give everyone the biggest choice
2014-09-25T07:58:23  <moarrr> maybe we should have 5000 altcoins
2014-09-25T07:58:39  <moarrr> proof-of-work, proof-of-play, proof-of-bandwidth, proof-of-burn, proof-of-almostanything
2014-09-25T07:58:46  <moarrr> make everything diverse and different
2014-09-25T07:59:02  <moarrr> you could have an altcoin that rewards people for exercising
2014-09-25T07:59:05  <moarrr> like connect to a fitbit
2014-09-25T07:59:06  * Cygnus-XI scratches head... wonders if there is already 5000 alts lol
2014-09-25T07:59:17  <moarrr> or rewards people for peer reviewing academic papers
2014-09-25T07:59:25  <moarrr> or rewards people for doing any verifiable act
2014-09-25T07:59:31  <moarrr> thats positive
2014-09-25T07:59:59  <moarrr> maybe a coin that rewards people for creative writing
2014-09-25T08:00:03  <moarrr> with a distributed reputation system built in
2014-09-25T08:00:22  <moarrr> like nxt + proof-of-publication
2014-09-25T08:00:22  <moarrr> lol
2014-09-25T08:00:39  <moarrr> you could have a way to distribute patents/copyrights too
2014-09-25T08:00:43  <moarrr> patentcoin
2014-09-25T08:00:52  <moarrr> seems like the possibilities are endless
2014-09-25T08:01:08  <Cygnus-XI> they are ;)
2014-09-25T08:01:21  <moarrr> imagine a computation-based coin that rewarded people for coming up with mathematical proofs
2014-09-25T08:01:25  <moarrr> and the coin itself checked the proofs
2014-09-25T08:01:37  <moarrr> then you wont have arguments over who solved what
2014-09-25T08:01:42  <moarrr> or peopel trying to cheat
2014-09-25T08:01:59  <moarrr> maybe a coin that checked cryptographic algorithms, or software, to make sure it doesnt have security flaws
2014-09-25T08:02:03  <moarrr> and it was 100% trustless and distributed
2014-09-25T08:02:12  <Cygnus-XI> AI is so smart these days though, just look at the Watson supercomputer
2014-09-25T08:02:19  <moarrr> hehe
2014-09-25T08:02:28  <moarrr> its not really about AI ;) just leveraging large networks to do amazing things
2014-09-25T08:02:46  <moarrr> each node can be pretty dumb, but together, millions of them are kinda smartish
2014-09-25T08:02:50  <moarrr> so it cant be abused very easily
2014-09-25T08:03:14  <moarrr> im not sure what my opinion on AI is, i watch the terminator movies
2014-09-25T08:03:24  <moarrr> and think to myself what might happen if the idea runs loose
2014-09-25T08:03:27  <Cygnus-XI> yea, I guess it just borderlines it in that example, there is a new expirement of a learning baby AI that is turning out to be interesting
2014-09-25T08:03:37  <moarrr> ah
2014-09-25T08:03:51  <Cygnus-XI> I think its called baby x
2014-09-25T08:04:07  <moarrr> a hacker + and AI sounds like a bad combination, flip a bit, and your benevolent ai = malevolent ai
2014-09-25T08:04:31  <moarrr> the difference between "Save all humans" and "Kill all humans" to a machine may simply be the difference between a 0 and a 1
2014-09-25T08:04:43  <moarrr> or "Torture all humans" and "Pleasure all humans"
2014-09-25T08:04:44  <Cygnus-XI> scary huh
2014-09-25T08:04:54  <moarrr> flipping a bit is the simplest operation in computer science
2014-09-25T08:04:56  <moarrr> NOT gate
2014-09-25T08:05:31  <moarrr> i think its clearly a wise idea to not act too hasty
2014-09-25T08:05:36  <moarrr> especailly when doing huge things
2014-09-25T08:06:29  <Cygnus-XI> even eintsien knew our technology was out growing our humanity many years ago
2014-09-25T08:06:35  <moarrr> indeed
2014-09-25T08:06:43  <moarrr> einstein allowed nuclear bombs, but he also allowed nuclear power
2014-09-25T08:06:44  <Cygnus-XI> like.... 70 years ago know i think
2014-09-25T08:07:00  <Cygnus-XI> yea, he hated himself for it too
2014-09-25T08:07:21  <moarrr> he was probably decieved ("we wont use your talents for evil, now take all this money and power and stuff")
2014-09-25T08:07:51  <moarrr> then agian, how many people would not be around without E=mc2
2014-09-25T08:07:55  <moarrr> we might have a shorage of electricity or power
2014-09-25T08:08:01  <moarrr> maybe a plague would have wiped out humanity
2014-09-25T08:08:07  <moarrr> shortage
2014-09-25T08:08:11  <moarrr> he might have saved us in some subtle way
2014-09-25T08:08:24  <moarrr> science seems to be keeping alot of things working
2014-09-25T08:08:29  <moarrr> and his equations too
2014-09-25T08:08:57  <Cygnus-XI> I dunno, people lived for a long time without all this fancy tech junk
2014-09-25T08:09:12  <moarrr> im pretty sure we wouldnt have 7 billion peopel on this planet alive if it wasnt for most scientific discoveries over the past 200 years
2014-09-25T08:09:18  <moarrr> anti-biotics
2014-09-25T08:09:26  <moarrr> the ability to build houses cheaply and easily
2014-09-25T08:09:30  <moarrr> the green revolution
2014-09-25T08:09:38  <moarrr> norman

2014-09-25T08:09:54  <moarrr> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Borlaug
2014-09-25T08:09:57  <moarrr> he alone could have saved billions
2014-09-25T08:10:19  <moarrr> maybe stopping another world war
2014-09-25T08:10:31  <moarrr> computers are another innovation that probably stopped alot of problems
2014-09-25T08:10:48  <moarrr> (i assume there are 7 billion people approximately because i trust that, havent checked it tho)
2014-09-25T08:11:00  <moarrr> but im sure there are alot of people
2014-09-25T08:11:08  <moarrr> hans rosling is another cool guy
2014-09-25T08:11:12  <moarrr> his ted talks are amazing
2014-09-25T08:11:52  <moarrr> we could survive without tech, the world would just be smaller and simpler (and quite possibly more painful and disease-filled)
2014-09-25T08:11:57  <moarrr> probably a lower standard of living
2014-09-25T08:11:57  <Cygnus-XI> I always say there are 3 sides to a coin, many forget the other edge in between the surfaces of a coin (physical coins atleast, not sure about crypto)
2014-09-25T08:12:02  <moarrr> but maybe we would have better food and a more natural lifestyle
2014-09-25T08:12:12  <moarrr> Cygnus-XI: good point
2014-09-25T08:12:18  <moarrr> but to me thats the difference between a coin and a surface
2014-09-25T08:12:22  <moarrr> a surface has two sides
2014-09-25T08:12:27  <moarrr> a coin has two sides, and an interface
2014-09-25T08:12:40  <moarrr> but what is more real, a coin or a surface?
2014-09-25T08:13:44  <moarrr> 3d engine designers/coders would probably debate stuff like this
2014-09-25T08:13:53  <moarrr> imho, i dont think we really understand reality enough even with todays knowledge
2014-09-25T08:14:23  <Cygnus-XI> crypto coin or physical coin? lol, seems like a trick question either way, but i would go with neither, considering surfaces are an illusion filled with 99.9% empty space
2014-09-25T08:14:31  <moarrr> well a tangible coin lol
2014-09-25T08:14:37  <moarrr> a cryptocoin has 0 edges ;)
2014-09-25T08:14:40  <moarrr> its just made of bits
2014-09-25T08:14:50  <moarrr> indeed Cygnus-XI
2014-09-25T08:14:54  <moarrr> if surfaces dont exist, then coins dont exist
2014-09-25T08:15:02  <moarrr> you are just looking at something that looks liek something when its actualyl something else
2014-09-25T08:15:28  <moarrr> one substance will look one way to the eye, but antoher way if you have a mass spectrometer
2014-09-25T08:15:36  <moarrr> things probably look different depending what species you are
2014-09-25T08:15:42  <Cygnus-XI> yea, perception and physics are an interesting thing to ponder
2014-09-25T08:15:42  <moarrr> senses are slightly different
2014-09-25T08:15:45  <moarrr> some animals see ultraviolet
2014-09-25T08:15:51  <moarrr> or infrared
2014-09-25T08:16:07  <moarrr> maybe your cat could be outsmarting you because it senses things better
2014-09-25T08:16:44  <moarrr> anyway, man, im exhausting myself - i think im gonna go watch some news
2014-09-25T08:16:49  <moarrr> or flick through the channels
2014-09-25T08:17:14  <moarrr> if you see any curecoin memorobilia or coins or pendants i can waer, let me know, i havent seen any yet
2014-09-25T08:17:48  <moarrr> i wanna collect lots of altcoin stuff :)

2014-09-25T14:27:02  <moarrr> hey
2014-09-25T14:27:05  <moarrr> i was just thinking
2014-09-25T14:27:10  <moarrr> what do you people think of my dietary plan?
2014-09-25T14:27:15  <moarrr> My personal dietary guidelines (plant/vegetable-based diet - 75%, fish-based - 20%, other animal products 5% / avoid too much grain/veg-oil)
2014-09-25T14:27:22  <moarrr> its based on my personal experinces and everything I have learned
2014-09-25T14:27:41  <moarrr> oh yeh, other idea is to eat a wide diverse variety of foods
2014-09-25T14:27:53  <moarrr> prepared in different ways or by different cultures
2014-09-25T14:28:04  <moarrr> rare foods are a plus (ie, uncommon foods)
2014-09-25T14:28:21  <moarrr> i think our food system is getting too unified and it might be causing health problems
2014-09-25T14:28:23  <moarrr> anyone agree?

2014-09-25T14:30:16  <moarrr> safety is key too
2014-09-25T14:30:23  <moarrr> (make sure your careful)
2014-09-25T14:31:09  <moarrr> its a semi-ketogenic semi-natural semi-raw semi-vegetarian semi-dairy semi-environmental semi-antipullutant semi-organic semi-everything diet
2014-09-25T14:31:32  <moarrr> basically avoid all the common things most people eat
2014-09-25T14:33:08  <moarrr> im just wondering if there are magic molecules hidden in the diversity of different species that are lacking that are causing problems when they are lacking
2014-09-25T14:33:21  <moarrr> maybe an anti-common diet is the answer
2014-09-25T14:33:28  <moarrr> it shouldnt be expensive or difficult if your creative

2014-09-25T18:54:11  <DanMAbraham> controlling your drinking is actually harder than it looks
2014-09-25T18:54:19  <DanMAbraham> its easy to forget how much alcohol a drink has
2014-09-25T18:54:32  <DanMAbraham> or to subtly manipulate yourself to fool yourself into thinking your drinking less than you are
2014-09-25T18:54:53  <DanMAbraham> hey all
2014-09-25T19:33:30  <Cygnus-XI> Hey DanMAbraham , how's your day going
2014-09-25T19:38:06  <Cygnus-XI> Years ago I had a hardcore body builder tell me a very interesting outlook on drinking vs exercise. It was pretty enlightening. Its hard to follow a steady workout until you get addicted to working out, or in my case "runners high". Just got off the treadmill and feeling great. Congrats on not drinking flood .
2014-09-25T19:39:02  <Cygnus-XI> Aiming to get back to 5 minute miles or less, slowly getting there
2014-09-25T19:41:08  <Cygnus-XI> I think about 2 - 3 months time I'll be there again. Also aiming for benching and butterflying ~ 30% more then my own body weight
2014-09-25T19:42:33  <Cygnus-XI> That is also about a 3 month process of everyday 1-2 lifting
2014-09-25T19:45:10  <DanMAbraham> Lol, I tried fitness before
2014-09-25T19:45:14  <DanMAbraham> and I realised it just wasnt for me lol
2014-09-25T19:45:28  <DanMAbraham> I mean, id like to look decent, but I think all I would ever want is a nice six-pack, im already naturally skinny
2014-09-25T19:45:31  <DanMAbraham> and i think ill be happy
2014-09-25T19:45:33  <Cygnus-XI> Its kinda like this core 0x15 work unit my GPU is folding.. Lol, core 15 makes my gtxs scream a terrible sound
2014-09-25T19:46:04  <DanMAbraham> ill get my girlfriend to do all the heavy lifting ;) j/k
2014-09-25T19:46:11  <Cygnus-XI> Lol
2014-09-25T19:46:25  <DanMAbraham> or my pawns ;)
2014-09-25T19:47:59  <Cygnus-XI> I was going to do some nacl units until I got a core 15, they draw so much more power then core 17
2014-09-25T19:50:25  <Cygnus-XI> I used to rely on being naturally skinny, then I hit age 30 :(
2014-09-25T19:51:05  <Cygnus-XI> If 90+ year olds can run marathons I can't make excuses for myself
2014-09-25T19:53:23  <DanMAbraham> its not that i dont wanna be fit
2014-09-25T19:53:27  <DanMAbraham> its just that ive got other more pressing concerns
2014-09-25T19:53:34  <DanMAbraham> so to me, ill accept a minimal level of fitness
2014-09-25T19:53:50  <DanMAbraham> just being reasonable fit, minimal activity, six pack would be nice, looking reasonable decent
2014-09-25T19:53:56  <DanMAbraham> i dont need to be usain bolt or a body builder
2014-09-25T19:54:02  <DanMAbraham> i respect that to be their domain

2014-09-25T20:01:33  <DanMAbraham> just walk for maybe hours and hours even
2014-09-25T20:13:56  <Cygnus-XI> Well, I have to take care of a few things and get some plans rolling for the new articles journalists are asking for. Ghostbusters be ready for action soon ;)

2014-09-25T21:50:46  <FithGB> I am not sure I even want to sell any to be honest.

2014-09-26T01:06:44  <Cygnus-XI> well, just spoke to journalist again, we might have a proper story coming out that actually portrays curecoin the way I feel about it
2014-09-26T01:07:46  <Cygnus-XI> most journalists just look at our site and write what they think about it, get all the details messed up
2014-09-26T01:08:00  <ahmed_> nice congrats :)
2014-09-26T01:08:04  <ahmed_> that is true tho
2014-09-26T01:09:51  <Cygnus-XI> If boring is going to Chicago with curecoingirl and getting into millennium park past closing time by flashing our curecoin cards then I guess I dont know what fun is
2014-09-26T01:10:18  <ahmed_> pffft
2014-09-26T01:10:31  <ahmed_> fun == going to hashers united and missing uni :P

2014-09-26T09:42:40  <DanMAbraham> id like some feedback
2014-09-26T09:42:46  <DanMAbraham> maybe know if people can read the words well
2014-09-26T09:42:57  <DanMAbraham> great if i can get it from a diverse group (gender, ages, occupations, etc)
2014-09-26T09:42:58  <Curecoingirl> loveeee it it
2014-09-26T09:44:31  <DanMAbraham> if its suitable, ill probably post it to my twitter
2014-09-26T09:44:39  <Curecoingirl> do it
2014-09-26T09:45:03  * DanMAbraham wonders if he should encode a public or private key into the line colors LOL j/k
2014-09-26T09:45:20  * DanMAbraham did it with chalk on his chalkboard, used several different colours
2014-09-26T09:45:36  <DanMAbraham> it was quite quick and easy to do once you get the idea
2014-09-26T09:46:06  <DanMAbraham> then use a camera phone to take the picture and upload it to pc
2014-09-26T09:46:21  <Curecoingirl> i love art

2014-09-26T09:53:58  <moarrr> actually one thing i wanna do is draw 3d
2014-09-26T09:54:02  <moarrr> with the depth being represented by colour
2014-09-26T09:54:03  <moarrr> that would be funky
2014-09-26T09:54:28  <moarrr> so many ideas, so little time lol
2014-09-26T09:54:41  * moarrr pings Cygnus-XI
2014-09-26T09:55:00  <Curecoingirl> would be amazing
2014-09-26T09:55:13  * moarrr wonders where all the others in the curecoin team are, they dont speak much lol
2014-09-26T09:57:04  <moarrr> i drew someone i knew lol, im not that great at drawing faces but it came out sorta ok - used some interest chalk-colours lol
2014-09-26T09:57:12  <moarrr> she thought it was ok i think
2014-09-26T09:57:29  <moarrr> i think i wanna focus on clothes/shoes/jewelry designs tho
2014-09-26T09:58:23  <Curecoingirl> i love rainbows
2014-09-26T09:58:29  <moarrr> hehe
2014-09-26T10:00:26  <moarrr> i think i have enough colours to draw a rainbow into the design
2014-09-26T10:00:27  <moarrr> somewhere
2014-09-26T10:00:33  <moarrr> i bought alot of chalk for some reason
2014-09-26T10:05:36  <moarrr> http://imgur.com/pGzdDsy
2014-09-26T10:05:39  <moarrr> thats a rough idea i guess
2014-09-26T10:05:46  <moarrr> i can use the chalk sideways to brush colours against the board
2014-09-26T10:06:00  <moarrr> not sure, will probably figure it out later the best way to do this
2014-09-26T10:06:07  <moarrr> lol, im gonna end up smelling like chalkdust lol
2014-09-26T10:06:40  <moarrr> but meh the upper left quadrant does look somewhat rainbowish for now
2014-09-26T10:06:55  <moarrr> bbiab

2014-09-26T17:55:18  <vite> hopefully it should work with p2pool
2014-09-26T17:55:33  <Curecoingirl> ask cyg or lasershurt
2014-09-26T17:55:46  <Curecoingirl> but both of them are not here atm
2014-09-26T17:55:51  <vite> whats the current blockcount for curecoin?
2014-09-26T17:56:37  <DanMAbraham> ok i just made a small change my artwork
2014-09-26T17:56:39  <DanMAbraham> its a little doge sign

2014-09-26T17:58:15  <DanMAbraham> upper left quadrant (slightly to right) i put it
2014-09-26T17:58:29  <Curecoingirl> might be 20689
2014-09-26T17:58:34  <Curecoingirl> not sure
2014-09-26T17:58:36  <DanMAbraham> i was trying to mess aroudn with occlusion and putting lines behind the sign and in front of it
2014-09-26T17:58:38  <DanMAbraham> but meh,
2014-09-26T17:58:46  <Curecoingirl> vite
2014-09-26T17:58:49  <DanMAbraham> i guess i could do that for most of the altcoins
2014-09-26T17:58:53  <DanMAbraham> just takes time
2014-09-26T17:58:54  <vite> well ive downloaded 5000 blocks in about 5 min
2014-09-26T17:58:54  <Curecoingirl> i like it
2014-09-26T17:59:04  <Curecoingirl> i could be wrong
2014-09-26T17:59:11  <Curecoingirl> im social media lol
2014-09-26T17:59:12  <DanMAbraham> noblecoin interested me a while ago, i bought some, they said they do alot of nice things to help people
2014-09-26T17:59:21  <vite> hmm says I'd make about 200k ccn with a 60ghs
2014-09-26T17:59:24  <DanMAbraham> it was kinda a funny coin
2014-09-26T17:59:27  <DanMAbraham> cleanwatercoin was interesting too
2014-09-26T17:59:29  <DanMAbraham> globalboost
2014-09-26T17:59:38  <DanMAbraham> theres so many now i kinda assume some will turn scammy tho
2014-09-26T17:59:40  <Curecoingirl> coins coins coins
2014-09-26T17:59:51  <DanMAbraham> there was some kidna savecoin
2014-09-26T17:59:55  <DanMAbraham> that just made me laugh it looked so flawed
2014-09-26T18:00:03  <DanMAbraham> lgbtcoin
2014-09-26T18:00:06  <Curecoingirl> yeah pump n dump bs
2014-09-26T18:00:07  <DanMAbraham> primecoin was interesting
2014-09-26T18:00:12  <vite> well if you see a node from Panama, thats me
2014-09-26T18:00:13  <DanMAbraham> i donated some primecoin to seans outpost
2014-09-26T18:00:20  <DanMAbraham> still got to help some guy donate some more stuff there
2014-09-26T18:00:50  <DanMAbraham> huntercoin i never got the client working, the blockchain seemed like it would take weeks to sync and it slowed my pc to a crawl
2014-09-26T18:00:59  <vite> ok about 13 coins a day on my small rig
2014-09-26T18:01:20  <Curecoingirl> seans outpost is awesome
2014-09-26T18:01:32  <Curecoingirl> they were next to us at btc chicago
2014-09-26T18:01:33  <DanMAbraham> yeh lol, i donated like 1 BTC to them
2014-09-26T18:01:40  <DanMAbraham> i donno why, the price must have been low at the time
2014-09-26T18:01:50  <DanMAbraham> i wasted so much BTC beceause i didnt understand it would be worth so much
2014-09-26T18:01:59  <DanMAbraham> lol, it was like pissing away a fortune
2014-09-26T18:02:24  <Curecoingirl> lol
2014-09-26T18:02:24  <DanMAbraham> i suppose thats the problem with deflationary assets
2014-09-26T18:02:27  <DanMAbraham> you just dont know :P
2014-09-26T18:02:32  <Curecoingirl> yeah..
2014-09-26T18:02:44  <DanMAbraham> thats why i only really buy gold to hold up my gemstones
2014-09-26T18:02:45  * vite thinks if he gets a 1 btc donation he would run a fee-less p2pool node excusively for curecoin and keep his rig running for about 1 year...
2014-09-26T18:02:48  <DanMAbraham> too much fake gold and crap
2014-09-26T18:03:08  <Curecoingirl> omgs
2014-09-26T18:03:10  <Curecoingirl> lol
2014-09-26T18:03:13  <DanMAbraham> vite: you should have met me years ago, when btc was between 2$ and $100 i probably would have given most people btc
2014-09-26T18:03:23  <DanMAbraham> then again when it went up to $1200 i kinda thought, hmm, this is scary
2014-09-26T18:03:33  <Curecoingirl> hahaha   the good days
2014-09-26T18:03:36  <DanMAbraham> yup yup
2014-09-26T18:03:39  <vite> DanMAbraham, I am running a p2pool node out of spite for centralized pools just showing how easy it is to run
2014-09-26T18:03:51  <DanMAbraham> vite: hehe, thats a good one
2014-09-26T18:04:04  <DanMAbraham> vite: i remember perusing /r/bitcoin
2014-09-26T18:04:06  <vite> net lost about $99 a month LOL
2014-09-26T18:04:15  <DanMAbraham> they always complain when someones close to 51%ing bitcoin
2014-09-26T18:04:21  <DanMAbraham> its like a panic every time it happens
2014-09-26T18:04:58  <vite> no one ever comes close to %51, closest they have been is %42 and then miners are smart enough... to change to a different pool.
2014-09-26T18:05:08  <DanMAbraham> its hard to measure vite
2014-09-26T18:05:13  <DanMAbraham> you dont know if someone is hiding hashing power
2014-09-26T18:05:16  <vite> DanMAbraham, checkout discus fish pool, they are very very very very very scary
2014-09-26T18:05:23  <DanMAbraham> or trying to create a chain without anyone noticing
2014-09-26T18:05:30  <DanMAbraham> i dont know how accurate those numbers are tbh
2014-09-26T18:05:38  <DanMAbraham> thats part of the reason i moved to alts
2014-09-26T18:05:39  <Curecoingirl> ok i will be away for a min
2014-09-26T18:05:42  <DanMAbraham> i just saw the bitcoin users get too greedy
2014-09-26T18:05:50  <DanMAbraham> and knew they might very well jepeardise the entire project
2014-09-26T18:05:56  <DanMAbraham> darkcoin uses X11 algo
2014-09-26T18:05:58  <DanMAbraham> so they are safer
2014-09-26T18:06:02  * Curecoingirl jumps off bridge
2014-09-26T18:06:06  <DanMAbraham> many altcoins use lots of weird and different algos
2014-09-26T18:06:06  <Curecoingirl> :P
2014-09-26T18:06:10  <DanMAbraham> Curecoingirl: noooo
2014-09-26T18:06:24  <DanMAbraham> i wanna see a coin that implements a different signature algo to ECDSA
2014-09-26T18:06:25  <vite> DanMAbraham, you can create a chain easily, just mod the client's creation algo and difficulty. hide it... then safe it and redo the algo with a huge blockchain already in store..
2014-09-26T18:06:28  <Curecoingirl> im having toooo many probs
2014-09-26T18:06:29  <DanMAbraham> maybe unbalanced salt and fish :P
2014-09-26T18:06:30  <Curecoingirl> lol
2014-09-26T18:06:32  * DanMAbraham kids
2014-09-26T18:06:40  <DanMAbraham> unbalanced oil and vinegar
2014-09-26T18:06:45  <Curecoingirl> eeeew
2014-09-26T18:06:52  <vite> 14k blocks
2014-09-26T18:07:09  <DanMAbraham> im not an expert on cryptograph
2014-09-26T18:07:14  <DanMAbraham> im not sure what could replace ECDSA tbh
2014-09-26T18:07:26  <DanMAbraham> im not sure if RSA or some other algo based on prime factorisation would work
2014-09-26T18:07:34  <DanMAbraham> but im sure a backup plan is always a good idea
2014-09-26T18:08:06  <DanMAbraham> the scary but unlikely chance that the discrete logarithm problem is solved kinda makes me unforcomfortable if for example a large amount of wealth entered bitcoin (ie, trillions)
2014-09-26T18:10:21  <DanMAbraham> i kinda realised recently, that digital signatures is simular to real signatures
2014-09-26T18:10:35  <DanMAbraham> maybe we will create an algorithm based on real signatures and handwriting recognition algorithms
2014-09-26T18:10:41  <DanMAbraham> so you can sign your bitcoin transactions with a pen
2014-09-26T18:10:43  <DanMAbraham> (or other altcoins)
2014-09-26T18:11:11  <DanMAbraham> people then use a graphics tablet or some sort, instead of some crazy math that very people understand
2014-09-26T18:11:20  <DanMAbraham> and maybe we can hash on an abacus
2014-09-26T18:11:23  <DanMAbraham> lol
2014-09-26T18:12:01  <DanMAbraham> i guess maybe i just have too many ideas and not enough people around me :)
2014-09-26T18:12:13  * DanMAbraham wonders how it feels to goto a great university like harvard or oxford

2014-09-26T18:26:20  <Curecoingirl> Vite talk to ahmed_
2014-09-26T18:26:42  <vite> ahmed does the bot have a blockcount and time to last block command?
2014-09-26T18:26:45  <ahmed_> vite: CryptoExpert's is essentially a modified version of bitcoin's gribble

2014-09-26T18:26:55  <ahmed_> not for curecoin atm
2014-09-26T18:27:10  <ahmed_> @list explorer
2014-09-26T18:27:10  <CryptoExpert> ahmed_: blockcount, difficulty, and nethash

2014-09-26T18:27:17  <CryptoExpert> ahmed_: CURE currently has a block count of <h1>Not found</h1>
2014-09-26T18:27:33  <ahmed_> someone should try getting curecoin on chainz.cryptoid.info
2014-09-26T18:27:38  <ahmed_> that way it'll work with the bot
2014-09-26T18:27:38  <Curecoingirl> good bot u have what was wrong with the old one
2014-09-26T18:27:53  <Curecoingirl> maybe u should un ban it since im in charge cyg said
2014-09-26T18:27:55  <ahmed_> Curecoingirl: the old one kept spewing out error messages constantly
2014-09-26T18:28:08  <ahmed_> oh that bot
2014-09-26T18:28:12  <ahmed_> no thanks.
2014-09-26T18:28:14  <Curecoingirl> oh i didnt know i didnt use it
2014-09-26T18:29:03  <vite> ahmed_, do you know if p2pool and curecoin play nice?
2014-09-26T18:29:11  <ahmed_> vite: it should do
2014-09-26T18:29:26  <vite> what are the rpcports and rpc I should set on the config file?
2014-09-26T18:29:27  <ahmed_> p2pool will need a mod to support tx messages though if you want it 100% efficient
2014-09-26T18:29:49  <ahmed_> (otherwise it runs at ~30% efficiency or maybe not at all)
2014-09-26T18:30:02  <ahmed_> no idea you'd have to check the source code
2014-09-26T18:30:13  <ahmed_> src/protocol.h and src/net.cpp i think
2014-09-26T18:30:29  <Curecoingirl> look at yr wallet for the info
2014-09-26T18:32:54  <vite> ahmed_, thats the issue I am getting http://pastebin.com/vQYhkUWe
2014-09-26T18:33:21  * vite modded the curecoin conf... but wanted to know if there are specific ports
2014-09-26T18:33:26  <vite> not too much info on y our docs
2014-09-26T18:33:28  <ahmed_> vite: curecoin isnt merged mineable
2014-09-26T18:33:36  <vite> ah ok
2014-09-26T18:33:50  <vite> well shame I guess that kills the help I can provide

2014-09-29T05:11:08  <Cygnus-XI> Im doing pretty good. Curecoin price shot up a lot in the last couple days , so thats pretty exciting :)
2014-09-29T05:12:54  <Curecoingirl> I seen that
2014-09-29T05:15:09  <Cygnus-XI> Ive been talking to a lot of people about what buying curecoins entails in terms of supporting research, maybe one of them listened 0.o
2014-09-29T05:16:56  <Curecoingirl> hmmm.
2014-09-29T05:17:36  <Cygnus-XI> I really like the description we use about how its like buying carbon offsets, except with this its like buying research offsets, you are paying someone to fold by buying their coins, and encouraging more folding so they can pay power bills
2014-09-29T05:17:56  <Curecoingirl> yeahhh awesomeness
2014-09-29T05:19:00  <Cygnus-XI> carbon offsets has a bad ring to it anyways, an excuse to pollute the air for any reason
2014-09-29T05:19:30  <Cygnus-XI> at least with the research offset concept you know the energy is being put to good use
2014-09-29T05:24:05  <Curecoingirl> yes

2014-09-29T23:54:40  <LasersHurt> Evening
2014-09-29T23:55:13  <MoTown> Any info on why the price fell to mere penny?  <after such a sucessfully conference>
2014-09-29T23:57:14  <LasersHurt> No particular reason, AFAIK. Just a bunch of folks deciding to sell
2014-09-29T23:57:38  <LasersHurt> Great time to buy on the cheap!
2014-09-29T23:58:13  <MoTown> Thats ok.  I been folding for it, but with the price action not going to buy it with money
2014-09-29T23:58:31  <MoTown> seems very little up, just down. :(
2014-09-29T23:59:43  <LasersHurt> There's just not a lot of market action. I suspect it will remain that way as long as there's not much to do with CC but hold or sell.
2014-09-30T00:00:25  <MoTown> Least makes the blockchain easy to download and keep up to date
2014-09-30T00:00:31  <LasersHurt> I recommend holding, of course - CC's long term future looks really, really good. It's a slow pattern until the most important stuff begins to become public knowledge, though.
2014-09-30T00:00:55  <MoTown> o i'm holding as selling at this price is pointless
2014-09-30T00:01:08  <MoTown> least i got some expereince in cypo coins, wallets, etc
2014-09-30T00:02:35  <FifthGhostbuster>   MoTown have you seen this from the pre ann?
2014-09-30T00:02:37  <FifthGhostbuster> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvPoRrj3QF5sdGlxUzdKVVgyaWZvZGlaT195OEFKZmc&usp=sharing#gid=0
2014-09-30T00:03:59  <MoTown> no.  not sure what it is.
2014-09-30T00:04:38  <FifthGhostbuster> That is the layout of curecoin's coin distribution over 100 years
2014-09-30T00:05:46  <MoTown> umm.  100 years?
2014-09-30T00:07:16  <FifthGhostbuster> This coin plan's to be around for ever yes, so 100 years is laid out currently.
2014-09-30T00:08:06  <MoTown> o ok.  in the future.  thought anient aliens was folding or something.
2014-09-30T00:16:17  <FifthGhostbuster> =p
2014-09-30T00:16:25  <FifthGhostbuster> From launch
2014-09-30T00:33:23  <MoTown> Well, don't really understand that spreadsheet, but find the price chart for cure pretty sad.
2014-09-30T00:34:53  <MoTown> production is also going down but not in proportion of the price action.

2014-09-30T08:00:21  <b_lumenkraft>  >> @hybotics: @blumenkraft Yes, I could build a cluster of small ARM embedded boards.

2014-09-30T13:28:20  <ChristianVirtual> regarding the idea to build (ARM) cluster and fold ... no way ...
2014-09-30T13:29:31  <ChristianVirtual> even an Intel cluster is not working well to my understanding as regular latency on networks will impact the highly synchronized threads for folding
2014-09-30T13:29:56  <ChristianVirtual> SMP, 2P, 4P: that you can do ...
2014-09-30T13:30:09  <ChristianVirtual> Intel and AMD only
2014-09-30T13:30:57  <b_lumenkraft> ChristianVirtual: thank’s for your answer
2014-09-30T13:32:31  <ChristianVirtual> (Actually I also had once the idea to build a Raspberry Cluster and do some DC project; fun it would be)

2014-10-08T08:33:14  <DanMAbraham> just some basic maths made pretty ;)
2014-10-08T08:33:42  <DanMAbraham> <3 colours
2014-10-08T08:33:47  <DanMAbraham> <3 3d
2014-10-08T08:34:24  <DanMAbraham> im chatting with my friends in #darkcoin - wondering whats happenning with the price of all cryptos
2014-10-08T08:34:38  <Curecoingirl> i love colors
2014-10-08T08:37:04  <DanMAbraham> i know how to make maths easier to learn
2014-10-08T08:37:05  <DanMAbraham> lol
2014-10-08T08:37:06  <DanMAbraham> :)
2014-10-08T08:37:13  <DanMAbraham> use motion, 3d and colours

2014-10-08T08:37:32  <DanMAbraham> could make it cartoony too
2014-10-08T08:37:37  <DanMAbraham> this is the basic idea on how to rearrange an equation
2014-10-08T08:38:16  <DanMAbraham> you can show the process using code (ie, the 7 with the outline represents a movement)
2014-10-08T08:38:40  <Curecoingirl> draw me a pic
2014-10-08T08:38:46  <DanMAbraham> of what?
2014-10-08T08:39:01  <Curecoingirl> something with lots of colors
2014-10-08T08:40:14  <DanMAbraham> i wanted to draw the precious stone diagram on my blog
2014-10-08T08:40:17  <DanMAbraham> but im not sure if i can right now
2014-10-08T08:40:20  <DanMAbraham> looks like it might be a little tricky
2014-10-08T08:40:28  <Curecoingirl> lol
2014-10-08T08:40:35  <DanMAbraham> im running low on coloured chalk too

2014-10-08T08:40:49  <DanMAbraham> i think i bought like 4 packs of white and 4 packs of coloured
2014-10-08T08:41:04  <DanMAbraham> someone wanted me to hash a block on my chalkboard lol

2014-10-08T13:31:40  <FithGB> Good morning
2014-10-08T13:33:01  <LasersHurt> Morning!
2014-10-08T13:33:50  <FithGB> How goes it?
2014-10-08T13:36:00  <LasersHurt> Dandy.
2014-10-08T13:36:48  <LasersHurt> Happened to see that there was a speaker at CMU this Thursday talking about Bitcoin, and as part of that Alternatives to it. I sent him a short email about CureCoin to see if he'd be interested in it.
2014-10-08T13:37:34  <FithGB> Very nice.  =p
2014-10-08T13:38:06  <FithGB> Has anyone else noticed weird WU distribution lately?
2014-10-08T13:42:38  <LasersHurt> Right now mine look normal.
2014-10-08T13:43:10  <FithGB> What about the past week?
2014-10-08T13:43:55  <LasersHurt> Haven't been monitoring too closely. I remember seeing some unfamiliar projects
2014-10-08T13:44:09  <LasersHurt> But not enough to say if it's generally "weird" lately
2014-10-08T13:45:11  <FithGB> Hmm past week or two I have been getting 2k point projects.  When I normally get 30k to 60k
2014-10-08T13:45:32  <FithGB> Till yesterday they began going normal again
2014-10-08T13:46:16  <FithGB> And I was get 0x15 and 0x16 instead of 0x17
2014-10-08T13:46:54  <LasersHurt> Ah they had a new assignment server in action: https://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=26807
2014-10-08T13:47:01  <LasersHurt> It gave out all osrts of stuff
2014-10-08T13:47:08  <FithGB> Only noticed cause my ppd went from 1.2m ppd to 400k
2014-10-08T13:47:10  <FithGB> Ahh
2014-10-08T13:51:05  <FithGB> Was just noticing.  It seems we were the only team effected by the new server for ppd?
2014-10-08T13:52:14  <FithGB> Everyone else is holding their normal ppd.  With same amount of active users.  And we are running half speed with same amount of WU done but half points.
2014-10-08T13:53:51  <LasersHurt> Interesting, it does seem to have really boned our 24hr average
2014-10-08T13:54:08  <LasersHurt> For a week at least
2014-10-08T13:54:31  <FithGB> Yet first place remains in effected?
2014-10-08T13:54:32  <FithGB> Un..
2014-10-08T13:57:12  <ChristianVirtual> I think its a fair guess to think that the BA-guyes where less impacted; more trouble with GPU as more older projects got assignd 0x15/0x16
2014-10-08T13:57:42  <ChristianVirtual> ah, I enjoy folding with Linux ... no 0x15 and 0x16
2014-10-08T14:00:12  <LasersHurt> Bit fishy, but looks like a lot of folders left our team too
2014-10-08T14:00:21  <LasersHurt> Well, 16 or something. Not a "lot"
2014-10-08T14:01:26  <ChristianVirtual> most likely just stopped folding the old projects; there were reports from one of you members that with AMD there was quite some trouble
2014-10-08T14:01:37  <ChristianVirtual> 0x16 and crashing system
2014-10-08T14:01:59  <ChristianVirtual> looks like those issues are also fixed for him ...
2014-10-08T14:02:42  <LasersHurt> Might explain why I've had terrible stability for a few weeks

2014-10-08T18:54:06  <DanMAbraham> just about ok
2014-10-08T18:54:14  <DanMAbraham> had doctors appt not long ago
2014-10-08T18:54:37  <DanMAbraham> just preparing for the bitcoin rally
2014-10-08T18:54:38  <DanMAbraham> :)
2014-10-08T18:54:43  <DanMAbraham> or crash
2014-10-08T18:54:46  <DanMAbraham> not really sure
2014-10-08T18:54:53  <DanMAbraham> im gonna play MOTO/BTC pair any way
2014-10-08T18:55:06  <DanMAbraham> and BTC/GBP if necessary
2014-10-08T18:55:50  <DanMAbraham> im just so poor its unbelievable
2014-10-08T18:55:52  <DanMAbraham> ol
2014-10-08T18:55:53  <DanMAbraham> lol
2014-10-08T18:56:20  <Cygnus-XI> Ah yes, btc flux... Lots of people have been asking me what of this price change, my response , I dunno, I just fold for curecoins
2014-10-08T18:56:42  <DanMAbraham> im pretty sure every altcoin that doesnt have a fiat market will be dependant on btc tho
2014-10-08T18:56:51  <DanMAbraham> so, ltc and drk are probably the only ones resistant to a btc shock
2014-10-08T18:56:55  <DanMAbraham> and maybe a few othrs like doge
2014-10-08T18:57:11  <DanMAbraham> but if you dont plan to trade cure for fiat, your probably ok
2014-10-08T18:57:30  <Cygnus-XI> Folding and holding ;)
2014-10-08T18:57:41  <DanMAbraham> hedge all your bets
2014-10-08T18:57:44  <DanMAbraham> i wouldnt hold just one crypto
2014-10-08T18:57:45  <DanMAbraham> lol
2014-10-08T18:58:34  * DanMAbraham is moarrr
2014-10-08T18:58:40  <Cygnus-XI> I have one multi cloud miner going, haven't looked at in a while.
2014-10-08T18:58:43  * DanMAbraham is moarrr
2014-10-08T18:58:56  <DanMAbraham> ive got like 0.1 or so btc
2014-10-08T18:58:57  <DanMAbraham> so thats enough fo rme
2014-10-08T19:02:24  <DanMAbraham> Cygnus-XI: hows your life going anyway?
2014-10-08T19:02:26  <DanMAbraham> any major problems?
2014-10-08T19:02:32  <Cygnus-XI> Soon enough people will see the flaw in the growing carbon footprint of non scientifically useful coins. Either that or man kinds greed will rip a whole in the ozone over hashing random numbers. With no cure in sight....
2014-10-08T19:03:01  <DanMAbraham> tbh i see the entire gold market as a waste
2014-10-08T19:03:03  <DanMAbraham> :PO
2014-10-08T19:03:04  <DanMAbraham> :P

2014-10-08T19:03:36  <Cygnus-XI> Life is OK these days. I'm actually rather content. Feeling at peace.
2014-10-08T19:04:09  * DanMAbraham shorts gold for fun
2014-10-08T19:04:28  <DanMAbraham> any news on curecoin@
2014-10-08T19:04:29  <DanMAbraham> ?
2014-10-08T19:04:31  <Cygnus-XI> "What I fight for is greater than silver or gold" - Matisyahu
2014-10-08T19:04:45  <DanMAbraham> gold and silver is basically an accounting system based on atoms rather than bits
2014-10-08T19:05:06  <DanMAbraham> nobody trusts it anyway lol
2014-10-08T19:05:56  <Cygnus-XI> Minus the protein folding , curecoin resembles that model.
2014-10-08T19:06:49  <Cygnus-XI> Kinda makes gold and silver look silly IMO
2014-10-08T19:08:05  <Cygnus-XI> No breaking news to report at the minute. Team is still working away on many different projects to improve curecoin
2014-10-08T19:08:36  <DanMAbraham> ok, lemme know i can always post on twitter any thing interesting or blog about it
2014-10-08T19:08:57  <wuffy68> chiming in - still a good idea to diversify ... I find gold useless, but I'm an amature gold miner. You wont get people in India, China and middle east to give up their gold anytime this century.
2014-10-08T19:09:15  <DanMAbraham> is curecoin really worth $ 0.012382 	eaach with 1.5mil coins?
2014-10-08T19:09:16  <Cygnus-XI> Cool, thanks for the support DanMAbraham
2014-10-08T19:09:39  <DanMAbraham> wuffy68: i dont care, their a fool for holding gold
2014-10-08T19:10:36  <DanMAbraham> if they dont understand why then i cant be bothered to explain
2014-10-08T19:10:58  <DanMAbraham> i used to be very pro-gold
2014-10-08T19:11:00  <DanMAbraham> until i realised human nature
2014-10-08T19:11:53  <wuffy68> I know - shiny commodity with limited usefulness - but a loooooong history of manipulation and false scarcity that's hard to beat.
2014-10-08T19:12:03  <Cygnus-XI> Well, gold is widely used in many of the devices we use to mine, surf the net, watch netflix, etc. Its non corrosion properties and conductivity make it useful even if people quit liking shiny things
2014-10-08T19:12:04  <DanMAbraham> can someone give me an idea of the curecoin price and total amount?
2014-10-08T19:12:05  <wuffy68> just like "greed is good" ... people somehow like it :-)
2014-10-08T19:12:11  <DanMAbraham> i wanna estimate market cap accurately
2014-10-08T19:12:55  <Cygnus-XI> Aye, math and science and stuff, still too early for that :)
2014-10-08T19:13:22  <Cygnus-XI> Dev mind activates at about 9 pm
2014-10-08T19:13:34  <wuffy68> there's a 100 years of mintage document on curecoin.net and a profitability calculator on cointweak
2014-10-08T19:13:48  <wuffy68> dont have time to get you the links .
2014-10-08T19:14:10  <Cygnus-XI> I'll try a rough estimate

2014-10-08T19:22:32  <DanMAbraham> i like precious gems
2014-10-08T19:22:35  <Cygnus-XI> $ 19,492$ 0.0124311hrm... Coinmarketcap still is not reporting total circulation right...
2014-10-08T19:22:47  <DanMAbraham> urgh im gonna have to modify my tweet then
2014-10-08T19:23:00  <DanMAbraham> theres too many coins that i cant even remotely guess at teh market cap
2014-10-08T19:23:01  <DanMAbraham> its annoying
2014-10-08T19:23:20  <DanMAbraham> but the total market (bitcoin+altcoin) have crashed from 10 billion to around 4 billion
2014-10-08T19:23:27  <DanMAbraham> cryptos are losing their perceived value at an alarming rate
2014-10-08T19:23:34  <DanMAbraham> i think its gonna get worse before it gets better
2014-10-08T19:23:51  <DanMAbraham> anyway, i g2g, Cygnus-XI take care ;)
2014-10-08T19:23:54  <DanMAbraham> you have my email if you wanna contact me
